      "Body": "# How to play\n\n## Just put your hand on the wasd and mouse.\n\n_ You will play a number of small games (very few). They are controlled with the mouse or wasd. You only have 10 seconds to figure out how to play each game and play it. Relax, they're all very simple and you don't need to finish every game, you just need spend 10 seconds on it! _\n\n# About the game\n\u003e(Contains spoilers, playing the game first)\n\nThe aim of making this game was to make something enjoyable.\n\n\nThese minigames are very simple, while contain tricks that may give you a little surprise. For example, in the Sokoban level the boxes explode when three of them connected in a line. \n\nSome of the mini-games have a lot of potential, such as Sokoban and Wizard. In the original plan they had many levels and would appear many times. But for some reason these were not completed. On the one hand, 48 hours is really too short. On the other hand, I'm not sure if the player can solve the more complex levels in 10 seconds. PUSHBOX2 would have been too complex. Even if you know the correct solution it's hard to finish on time.\n\nWizard is my favourite minigame. Destroy enemies with three special spells. Each spell sounds harmless, but the monsters disappear because of the Match-3 rule, so you can still start a massacre with them.\nUnfortunately only the tutorial level of the wizard was completed. By that time I hadn't slept for 20 hours straight whitch makes me had to turn to some easy games. I think even though taking Sorcerer out on its own would make for a good game. I wonder if you saw the potential of this game in 10 seconds.\n\n\n# Development work\n\nI really like the baba is you art style, where everything is wigglling. I think a shader witch makes the textures shift according to the noise can do this. But I chose the dumbest way. draw all the art assets three times. Three times! Hope it is worth.\n\n\nThe code work was very stifling. The first few hours I was doing some framework stuff like scene switching and cleaning up all the sprites at the end of the level. The work was pretty easy until I got to the minigames development stage. First of all, there were a lot of games that needed to be developed in original plan. It would take me hours to create one minigame, and that would only allow the player to play it for 10 seconds. For most of the time, there was no end in sight because even if I spent a super long time on a minigame, the whole game flowed still less than one minute. It was the hardest gamejam I've ever joined, but thank goodness it was finally finished. Barely finished, because there were only 10 minigames.If you were amused during the playthrough, it means my work was not in vain. \n\n![ld51.gif](///raw/b5d/34/z/51cfd.gif)",

      "Body": "\"Say something.\" Every 10 seconds.\n\n*A game barely made for Ludum Dare 51 Compo.*\n\nA card game about conversation, where you must say (play) something every 10 seconds! Play as Black, the discommunicative communicator, half-way coerced into a practice session with Red. Watch your partner's intents and keep the conversation going!\n\nThe game doesn't have BGM or any actual card art due to lack of time.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nThe game has a short integrated intro, but as a quick reminder just in case:\n\n### Game flow\n\n- Every 10 seconds, both parties take a simutaneous turn. Whenever a turn starts, everyone draws a card from their Deck.\n- Click on a card in your Hand (bottom-left) to select it. Selected cards are moved to your side of the Field (middle-left), from where it will be played at end of turn.\n- Only one card can be on each side of the Field at the same time. If you would select another card while there already is one, the card you clicked on would replace the one currently on the Field.\n- Each turn, when the timer runs out, the turn ends and the following happens:\n    - For each side of the Field, if it's empty, an \"Awkward Silence\" is generated and put there automatically. Not acting is itself an action!\n    - Effects on cards resolve.\n    - You gain or lost score equal to the sum of both cards' Values, depending on their Types. See below.\n    - Cards on the Field are moved to their owners' respective Discard piles.\n    - Everyone discards their leftmost cards to hand size (9).\n\n### Card attributes\n\n- Each card has a Type and a Value:\n    - Assertive cards are yellow. They are signified by upward-arrow symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n    - Receptive cards are blue. They are signified by downward-arrow symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n    - Deflective cards are pale. They are signified by hourglass symbols in the top-left corner, containing their value number.\n- Matches and Clashes:\n    - Assertive and Receptive cards Match with each other. Each Match made on the Field increases your score by the sum of the Value of both cards.\n    - Assertive and Assertive cards Clash with each other, so do Receptive cards with others of their kind. Each Clash made on the Field *decreases* your score by the sum of the Value of both cards.\n    - Deflective cards do not Match or Clash, but have negative value.\n- Each card also has a *Level*, represented as the number within the red circle, in the top-left corner of cards. Cards can only be played if the current *Conversation Level*, shown on the score meter located at the middle-right of the screen, is higher than its own level.\n\n### Trivia\n\n- Red always reveals the card she puts onto the Field at the start of turn. She's nice!\n\n## Tools\n\n- Godot Engine w/ Rust bindings\n- Krita\n- ChipTone for the very few sound effects\n\n## Fonts\n\nThis project redistributes multiple fonts by jeti (https://fontenddev.com/fonts/), licensed under CC BY 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n- Cartridge by jeti\n- Five by Five by jeti\n- Kapel by jeti\n- Lunch Menu by jeti\n- Microserif by jeti\n- Peanut Money by jeti\n- Squarewave by jeti\n- Poco by jeti\n",

The target number of ghosts is indicated in the upper-left corner (‚ÄòSacrifices‚Äô), while the remaining number of full night-day cycles is indicated right to the Power Pellet icon (also in the upper-left corner). *[In version 1.1, ‚ÄòHarvest‚Äô.]*\n\nThere is no maximum level, the game goes on (until level 49, see below). *[In version 1.1, the game goes back to level 1 after level 38.]*\n\n**COLOURBLIND MODE:** in colourblind mode, numbers get displayed to make up for colours (both on daytime ghosts and receivers).\n\n### Controls\n\n* **Arrow keys** to move the claw\n* **Space** to catch/release a ghost\n\n![Gameplay.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50103.gif \"Gameplay.\")\n\n![Level 1.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50073.png \"Level 1.\")\n\n![Failure in level 2.](///raw/3d5/84/z/50105.png \"Failure in level 2.\")\n\n![Colourblind mode.](///raw/3d5/84/z/526f9.png \"Colourblind mode.\")\n\n### Platforms\n\n* **Navigator: Disclaimer:** as fullscreen was not working properly, display is just a little different (smaller resolution, and also a small zoom out from v1.0.2). See this [devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/436556/navigator-version) for details about debugging.\n\n* **Linux:** it is somewhat uneasy to provide a one-size-fits-all Linux binary because of the variety of distributions, but using the **.love** file I uploaded, [having Love2D](https://love2d.org) should be enough. There is also a solution involving AppImage, although I could not test it. See [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution#Distribution_for_Linux) for more detail.\n\n### Versions\n\n**(05/10/2022)** Current legitimate Compo version is 1.0.1, which is basically version 1.0 + colourblind mode + level-skipping key.\n\n**(06/10/2022) OUT NOW:** post-Compo version 1.0.2 with better parameters for difficulty steepness and for the ghosts‚Äô ‚Äònight shift‚Äô duration. ;) Although this is really the original version ‚Äòdone right‚Äô‚Ä¶ I am not replacing the original one as I am not sure this would be fair, but you can still take a look if you want to see some more justice done to the game. See [devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/436510/version-102) for details (including better tiles and a difficulty fix). You can also **download** the 1.0.2 navigator version (in case you can make it run somewhere), but take notice that the current itch.io player runs 1.0.1.\n\n**(05/10/2022) HOPEFULLY COMING SOON:** post-Compo version 1.1 with stackable ghosts, and possibly a mode with pre-designed levels. Another idea I had and will try here, which is even simpler to program, is a *Tetris*-like ‚ÄòPanic Mode‚Äô where you get more ghosts with time, and have to take them out as long as possible before the whole space is full. (And also, getting the screen hidden or colours ‚Äòblurred‚Äô for some time as a penalty for holding a ghost at night, which would make more sense than merely getting immobilised.) I am willing to bet I would totally have had the time to make this one for the Jam deadline, and possibly the night of the Compo deadline. **(11/10/2022) OUT NOW:** modes are saved for a future version 1.2, but layers, more challenging difficulty, and a lot of user-friendly details have been added! :) The [mouthful devlog](https://mossieur-patate.itch.io/maudits-fantomes/devlog/438512/version-11) is there. Once again, **downloading** the 1.1 navigator version is possible. I think things are getting interesting here, stressing again out of fairness that this should **not** be judged as the Compo version, although it can give a hint about the game‚Äôs potential and extensions. (For the record, debugging collisions and shadows was a massive time black hole! This version would have been riddled with occasional front-depth shadows in competition conditions‚Ä¶) Either 1.1 or 1.2 is ‚ÄòJam version done right‚Äô.\n\n\n### A little backstory\n\nI came up very late with the complete idea, while I thought of the cheeky allusion to the famous arcade mechanic very quickly. I would have had the time for the whole layer mechanic and carefully crafted levels based on it (including implicit tutorial progression) had I not had so much trouble with my thought process (I wavered between a whole host of wildly different concepts!); actually, I might have been able to make it in less than one or two hours, and certainly for the Jam deadline, but I wanted to challenge myself for the Compo rules. Playtesting was also minimal with the final conditions, but having a series of increasingly difficult levels is a makeshift solution; the formulae are super easy to tweak, although I am unsure this would count as bug fixing‚Ä¶ (**Edit shortly thereafter:** I simply decreased the number of cycles. This was really one mere instruction and this feels way more reasonable! No change in mechanics.)\n\nI may upload a version with layers elsewhere, so stay tuned if you are interested! :slight_smile: (But not here, as I believe upgraded versions are not authorized even if the original stays available and pinpointed? Not sure, the rules do not say; maybe you know.)\n\n### Tools\n\n* **Framework:** [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)\n\n* **Sound effects:** [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) + [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)\n\n* Nothing else for the **graphics**, as everything here is managed entirely programmatically (except for the icon and thumbnail/cover), and often vectorially. So, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)! :slight_smile:\n\n* As a side note: for [reducing](https://www.iloveimg.com/fr/redimensionner-image) and [compressing](https://www.iloveimg.com/fr/compresser-image) the animated GIF, iLoveIMG is useful.\n\n### Known bugs\n\n[**All solved** in version 1.1]\n\n* Since I (voluntarily) let the grid at a constant size, and since there is no cap on the number of ghosts nor vertical stacking of ghosts programmed, I suspect you will run into an infinite loop if you reach too high a level. (A quick inequation solving leads me to believe this would be level 49. Hey, after all, the original *Pac-Man* had a [notorious bug for level 256](https://atari.fandom.com/wiki/Pac-Man/Level_256)! Mine is just not a cool power-of-2-related one.)\n\n* Ghosts sometimes collide, while they should not. This is only seldom a problem, except maybe in very advanced levels.\n\n* It seems that you sometimes cannot grab a ghost right after having released it. Unsure.\n\n* Not really a bug per say, but display depth is not (yet) handled, so, do not frown if you see a ghost pass behind another one when it should not. Consider it ghost magic. :3\n\n### Known non-bugs\n\n* v1.1: Ghosts will first finish their current movement (including staying still) before falling, in a Wile E. Coyote fashion: this is on purpose. :)\n\n* v1.1: preventing superimposition is dealt with by stacking upwards. See point 35 from the devlog.",

Jos√© Bonilla, i.e. me) in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 51 *Compo*.\n\n* Version: 1.0.0 (compo)\n* Genre: Puzzle platformer\n* Builds: Windows x64 - Download below and unzip to play\n* Total playtime: 15-20 minutes\n\n\n\n\n![Banner3.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe8.png)\n\nThis game is a **puzzle platformer** in which you do not control the character directly, but rather **instruct it actions** to perform at specific time slots of a 10-second period. You do so by **placing** different **action tiles** in the **timeline**:\n\n![UI-Timeline.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff0.png)\n\nAfter placing tiles there, you can start the commands by pressing the green **Play** button and stop the current run by pressing the **Stop** button. You can also press the **Restart** button to restart the level with a clean slate.\n\n**NOTE: ** There are **7 tutorial levels** and **6 regular levels** in the Compo build. Try to get all three stars in all levels! **The game will save your progress**.\n\nFinally there's an Options button to take you to level select and/or mange options (Sound/Music).\n\n### Controls\n\n* **Mouse Left click** - **place tiles** in the timeline, and generally **interact** with the game UI\n* **Mouse Wheel Up/Down** - scroll and **toggle between available action commands** for Ev'ry (see below). _Also used in the Main Menu for scrolling up/down for the level selection!_\n* **Mouse Right click** - use while over an already placed action in the timeline to remove it.\n\nThe actions you can specify are the following:\n\n* ![UI-Tile.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffff.png) **No action** or empty (doh!). By default all the timeline is empty.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles2.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff2.png) **Walk right**. Ev'ry will keep moving right unless told to stop explicitly.\n* ![UI-ActionTiles3.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4fff4.png) **Walk left**.

Ev'ry will duck to avoid hazards and remain ducked until further instructed to do otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n![Banner4.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe9.png)\n\n* **Game Design** by me, relatively inspired by King of Thieves\n* **Coding** by me - GameMaker 2022.8\n* **Art** by me - Aseprite\n* **Music and sounds** composed and performed by me (Roland GP 609 + Audacity)\n* **Font** is *Milky Coffee* by Syafrizal from dafont.com (https://www.dafont.com/milky-coffee.font)\n\n\n\n\n![Banner1.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffe6.png)\n\nNote that you **cannot drag and drop** tiles in the timeline.\n\n**UPDATE: A post-compo bug fix version has been released. See below**\n\nThere a a couple of bugs (now fixed in the post-compo bug fix release):\n\n- The **cannons** currently have a **small bug** that does not initialize their timings exactly the same every level restart. This can prove difficult to overcome the levels that contain cannons. If faced with this issue, try your same timeline configuration again several times.\n- Even though there is a **volume slider** in the options menu, it actually **does nothing**. This is a bug.\n- **Tutorial level 5** has a bug in which **certain ceiling tiles are not solid** and they should be.\n\nI **opted out** of the **Humor** category.\n\n**Source code** is included (see LD51.zip).\n\n\n\n\n![Banner5.png](///raw/371/a2/z/4ffea.png)\n\n* A **Post-Compo 1.0.2 version** has been released, fixing the above bugs and adding very small UI/UX enhancements. If you want to try it out, please go ahead. The bugs are not game-breaking but it's always nicer to play the clean version :)\n\nThe version control can be checked directly on [the Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/biyectivo/ld51/src/main/):\n\n1.0.2\n\n* Fixed a bug found by players on the GUI animations, where clicking restart twice would animate the GUI twice and would position it incorrectly\n* Fixed a bug on Level 5 that was introduced in 1.0.1 in which the timings of the barriers changed making the level impossible to finish.\n\n1.0.1\n\n* Cannon and barriers now reset their state every time, so they are predictable now on every run.\n* Fixed Tutorial Level 5 bug where certain ceiling tiles were not solid.\n* You can now press SPACEBAR to start/stop the timeline.\n* Improved timeline UI so initial selected tile is non-blank to avoid confusion and selected tiles are displayed with transparency to indicate they are not set\n* When levels are finished, current action sequence persists and is no longer wiped out, to allow for easier iteration over the same level. Note that the action sequence does not get permanently stored in the progress data, so quitting the game and restarting it will reset the sequences to blank.\n* Fixed Tutorial Level 5 bug where certain ceiling tiles were not solid.\n* Added Quit button in the title screen\n* Garbage-collected surfaces",

      "Body": "### Hovering Bird\n\nHovering Bird is a table game. The game is played by one player (solo). As the game rules are pretty simple, the game may be suitable even for children.\nThis game was inspired by Flappy Bird mobile game, where the player is tasked to pass through pairs of pipes which appear in equal time intervals (about every 10 seconds).\n\n### What is required\n1. A game field with numbers from 1 to 15 in order (can be easily drawn by hand)\n2. Some token to represent a bird\n3. A standard 52-card deck (with out jokers)\n\nThat's all!\n\n### Gameplay\n\nThe main character (as you already probably guess) is a bird. Player can control the bird, changing the height, where it is flying.\nA game field is served to track the current height.\nNext movement actions are possible:\n1. FLAP: bird flies up, moves up by 3\n2. HOVER: bird spreads its wings and hovers, moves down by 1\n3. DO NOTHING: bird falls down due to gravity, moves down by 2\n\n\n### Game start\n1. Put game field on the table\n2. Put Bird token on game field into any desired cell\n3. Shuffle the deck\n\n### Checkpoints\n\nEach card which will be dealt from the deck represents a checkpoint. Value of the card means height, which bird should reach.\nFor cards from 2 to 10 value corresponds to the rank, Jack means 11, Queen means 12, King means 13, Ace means 1 or 14 (player can reach either 1 or 14 to hit this checkpoint).\nIf bird reaches required height, then corresponding card should be taken away from the table.\nIf player hits checkpoint, he moves again. \nCheckpoints may be hit in any order.\nPlayer can hit only one checkpoint at a time (in case if several cards of the same rank were dealt).\n\n### Move order\n1. One card is dealt from the deck\n2. Player moves the bird (according to the movement rules)\n3. If player hit any checkpoint, he takes corresponding card away and should move again\n\n### Game over\n\nThere cannot be more than 3 cards (checkpoints) active at any moment. \nIf the 4th card should be dealt, then game is over. In this case, count the number of cards which were taken away before, this is your number of points!\n\n\n\nHere is short video example of game play:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzLar5MmU08\n\nGood luck!\n",

The catch? The cubes explode and respawn every 10 seconds. Fortunately, these cubes are special - they record their movement through space and time and will repeat those movements on the next try!\n\nTTL:10 has 10 levels plus one bonus stage. Code, art, and sound effects were created in 36 hours.\n\n# Controls\nMouse and keyboard only:\n- A or Left Arrow keys to move left.\n- D or Right Arrow keys to move right.\n- Space bar to jump.\n- Q and E to cycle between different cubes (**only while the timer isn't running**).\n- Fixed typo where I accidentally listed W instead of A for going left. I don't know what I was thinking?\n\nIf you get stuck, you can reset the level in the menu, or skip to another via level select.\n\n# Patch Notes\n- Added option to disable sounds.\n- Fixed bug causing cubes to fail to detect that they are grounded/able to jump.\n- Fixed bug where clicking the button for level 10 in the level select screen actually loaded level 9 instead.\n- Q and E instruction now turns red while the timer is running. Hopefully this should make it clear that you can only switch cubes between the 10 second cycles.\n- Fixed typo where I accidentally listed W instead of A for going left. I probably needed more sleep.",

Use the mixed up letters on the first line to form a word on the bottom line.  You have 10 seconds to guess a word.  I took some inspiration from Wordle but implementing a static set of words each day.  So each day you play you will get a new set of words (changes as approximately midnight your local time).  You can type, drag-drop, or simply click the letters to place them.  Gain points for correct guess, lose them for incorrect guesses.  A wrong guess with a letter in the correct spot awards a couple seconds of extra time.  Bonus points on correct guesses for each second left on the clock.\n\nYou can see your attempts in the left pane.  Underlined letters are in the correct place.  If you miss a word entirely, it'll show up in italic letters.\n\nThe first word is always 3 letters but it gets progressively more difficult.\n\nI have a huge document outlining new modes and features I want to add, so I fully expect to make this my current free time project.\n\nAs of 5 hours from deadline, I have also added sound!  Not the best sounds admittedly but sound nonetheless.  I've learned from previous entries and included a volume slider on the start-up screen as well.  Thought about some music but alas Bosca Ceoil is the only thing I was familiar with and it is apparently broken.\n\nhttps://simplepotential.com/projects/LD51/game.htm\n\n![titlescreen.png](///raw/384/z/4f566.png)\n![game1.png](///raw/384/z/4f567.png)\n\nMade entirely in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nUpdate 10/8/22:  Some of my play-testers have reported seeing the same word appear from a previous day.  I do not believe this is a bug but rather a result of a small word set for the longer words in my dictionary file.  The seed does appear to be working properly it just happens to be selecting the same words.  I'll be increasing the size of the dictionary at a later date as well as seeing if I can prevent same words on consecutive days.  If you know of any larger word files available for free, please let me know, most of the ones I've looked at will require a lot of clean-up effort.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n",

I figured it could be interesting for a testing purpose to give you a cheat sheet of the not obvious behaviors and interactions you can experience in the game. I highly recommend you to try the game before reading this small guide, since it will spoil you.

I am glad I made it in time, even though the game is very modest. I joined as a way to learn by practicing, and I am satisfied with what I got.\n\n\n# AFTER LAUNCH PATCH:\n## Patch 1.1:\nAfter a few friends tested the game, it was clear that the amounts and values of pickup items were too high. Hence, I updated the game with few values changed.\n### Spoiler alert\n- Flowers only give 1 if the player is not using a Hoe (before: amount represented by the flower sprite)\n- Change spawn amount of each flower (except Gold and Quenouille) to 6 (before 12 or 8)\n- Bushes gives 4 - 5 berries if the player is using a sword or axe (before: 2 - 5)\n- Bushes gives 2 - 6 berries if the player is not using a sword or axe (before: 2 - 5)\n- Monsters gives 2 - 5 monster fertilizers (before: 1 - 4)\n- Values: \n  - Heart Flower: 10 -\u003e 5\n  - Purple Flower: 5 -\u003e 4\n  - Quenouille: 10 -\u003e 8\n  - Fish: 10 -\u003e 8\n- Fixed game not restarting after Congratulations screen\n\nYou can still play the original version of the game and consider it as an \"Easier\" mode, however it was too simple to just pickup everything without tools and complete the game in less than a minute.\n\n## Patch 2.0\nI spent some more time after the event to polish the game a little bit more following feedbacks I got. Since this update brings a lot more than just balance tweaks or bug fixes, please don't play it before you've rated the game. Its changelog and release are on the GitHub page.",

Drawing a timeline on a paper may help.\n\n![3.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/4f7f3.png)\n\n## For time travel experts\n\n+ When you activate the time machine, don't look back. The last 10 seconds that you have been experienced are lost forever. But you'll have another 10 seconds lifetime in the reversed timeline.\n\n\n+ The rewind procedure is absolute, which means that even the heaviest things can't stop the rewinding objects.\n\n![5.png](///raw/7bf/92/z/4f7ff.png)\n\n## Skipping levels\n\n+ You are free to challenge the next 3 unfinished levels, which means that you can go to the next level if you cannot solve some puzzle,\n\n## Unintended solution?\n\n+ There are indeed different solutions other than the designed solution. I even figured out myself when testing the levels.\n+ I decided to keep them possible after all. **Feel frese to use trick to solve the puzzle!**\n\n",

It only half works, so I turned it off.\n- More effects, target types (cones), just more card parts. \n- Auto generation of cards, currently every card is manually set up (and some are kinda op).\n- Lighting\n- More enemy variation, more enemies, armored enemies etc.\n- Making the different defenders do different stuff/ be good at different things.\n- More Progression\n",

Because that was the first pixelart I created in my life and had no time for other enemies. I never tried pixelart style, but it was good. I learnt a lot even tough it was only 48hours. :smile: \n\n\n## Controls\n- Move = WASD\n- Change sword position = Left mouse move \n- Attack = Left mouse click\n- Menu: Escpae\n- Interact with locations: E\n- Dash: Space\n\n## Details\nThe game's goal is to get more points, however you only get the points if you escape through the Portal. (I did not have time to finish a score screen, so just now the game goes to the main menu if you click yes on the portal exit window.) If you just die, then 0 points. There are 6 lcoations you can visit in the game, but every 10 seconds they replace each others position, so you have to plan how you will go to the portal, because that is one of them too. If you are unlucky, you always lose the chance to reach it. (Or just wait there, but the slimes are still spawning)\n\n\n## Locations\n- Shrine (you can choose from powerups every 30 seconds[every 3 environment change])\n- Sanctuary (A magic barrier that explodes dealing AOE damage around it)\n- Well of Life (Gives you two HP)\n- Winery (You can get wine from the barrel near it)\n- Drunk Warrior (You can give the wine to him and he will do a strong AOE damage)\n- Portal (Game exit)\n\n## Powerups\nThere are several upgrades for stats\n- Health\n- Damage\n- And you can even get +points\n\n## Slime types\n- Simple green slime (Your average neighborhood slime)\n- Blue slime (he is THE fast, but deals less damage)\n- Brown slime (if blue is the fast, it is the big - what you can expect as always: slow movement \u0026 attack, but big damage)\n- Red slime (this is literally a bug in my game, i planned to shoot fireballs from it, but now it just damages you from far like a cheater)\n\n## What you can expect in this game\n- Bad pixelart and funny (at least how bad they are) animations\n- Somehow not bad particle effects\n- Some bugs\n- Silence (I forgot to create music, not like I had time to)\n\n## Softwares used\n- Game Engine: Unity + VS 2019\n- Art: Aseprite\n- Sound: sfxr and bfxr",

      "Body": "![screenshot-1.png](///raw/a8f/54/z/4fe48.png)\n\nA farming sim based around not having enough hours in the day to do everything. Days last 10 seconds and you have to plant seeds, maintain crops, harvest, buy seeds and some gifts to give your loved one with the goal of progressing your relationship enough to accomplish your life goals. Make sure to remember to collect your tools each day or you'll have to spend half the day going back for em!\n\nIn Life is Fleeting you cannot die. When you accomplish your life goals and complete the game, you can see how much money you've earned, how many crops you've harvested and how many days you've lived on the farm.\n\nThe whole idea of this game is to take a relaxing farm sim and add a slightly more frantic nature to things while still maintaining chill vibes and simplicity. When I saw the theme \"10 seconds\" this for whatever reason is what came to mind. I've been needing a little more peace recently and this felt like the perfect thing for me to work on.\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/a8f/54/z/4fe4b.png)\n\nIf I had a little more time I would definitely create a longer main song to play along with and songs for the title and win screens. I would also animate the player's love interest/partner and clean up sprites and give the player character a redo but I'm quite happy with it. Most of all, the buildings and fences would have collisions enabled but at the very least, 10 seconds a day makes it a little less noticable!\n\nMy confidence as a game dev has been rather low for a long time now so I'm just hoping to have made something half decent. At the very least, I never thought I'd be able to complete a game jam entry within 2 days and I managed it in 32 hours!\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/a8f/54/z/4fe4e.png)\n\nAnyways! Thank you for taking a look and I hope you get a few minutes of fun out of all of this! I've really enjoyed this jam. It's my second Ludum Dare and I'll 100% be back for more!",

But you can be the problem or the solution, and I'm not going to say which one is the solution.\n\nProtect: keep the kitties from getting pounded by the hammer that falls every 10 seconds.  A new kitty is also spawned every 10 seconds, so eventually this is like herding cats.  Well...  It *is* herding cats.\nhttps://youtu.be/aZA4yUHDmUg\n\nPound: the kitties aren't taking the bait (free catnip).  You must intervene and place them on the target just in time for them to meet their demise.  I'd consider this one easy mode for now, but I'll eventually make multiple kitties spawn so it's hard to kill those disgusting...  Er, I mean harder to win the game.\nhttps://youtu.be/A0dhtcfIE4s\n",

Every 10 seconds:\n* Market is updated\n* Resources are generated\n* Opportunities appear\n\nI encourage you to post your fastest time to beat the game or the longest time you survived for (I'm not yet sure if it's difficult or not).\n\n**NOTE:** The game throws you into tutorial and after finishing it or skipping it you get a real match.\n\n![1.png](///raw/51b/z/4faca.png)\n\n![5.png](///raw/51b/z/4facf.png)\n\n![7.png](///raw/51b/z/4fad2.png)\n\n## Controls\nThe game contains a tutorial, that starts once the game is open (not when restarting after game over).\n\n**F2** - Skip tutorial.\n\n**Mouse left click** - All actions.\n\n**ESC** - Unselect.\n\n## Tips and info\n- Fleet units stack, if there is at least one in the build area (blue tiles). You can move fleet away to create a new stack, or move them back to make a stack bigger.\n\n- Enemy renews blockade, unless all blockading ships are destroyed.\n\n## Scoreboard\n1. ZLuca - 21 min 39 sec\n2. Jimbly - 32 minutes\n3. Paja - 40 min 21 sec\n\n## Running the game\n\nOn Windows you can download the zip which includes Java JRE so that you don't have to download it. Start the game by running run.bat script.\n\nThe game is available as .jar file or source code. It was developed on Linux (KDE Neon) system, but should be platform independent.\n\n### The game does not run\nIt's mostl likely that you're missing the needed Java stuff - you just __need to have the latest Java SDK__ ([download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)).\n\n### Windows\n\nJust double click the file and it should open if you have Java SDK installed.\n\n### Linux and Mac\n\nIf double click does not work for you then just type `java -jar GalacticTraders.jar` in terminal in the folder where you downloaded the game.\n(In case downloading jdk from link above was not helpful, look in your repos for `java-11-openjdk-11.0.12.0.7.4.fc34.x86_64` by using your packaging app like `sudo dnf install ...`/`sudo apt-get install ...` or similar.)\n\n## About the game(dev)\nThis is a COMPO entry (made within 48 hours) all by me (the art, sound effects, fonts, code...).  \nI made this in Java using my custom hand made engine (that's why it's somewhat small, but might have some problems with portability... oops).\n\n### Post compo edits\n- Changed the text at the end of a tutorial to \"Tutorial finished\" from \"Victory\" and \"Press [Enter] to restart\" to \"Press [Enter] to start a real match\" to avoid confusion. \n- Fixed bug, where enemy blockade was renewed also if it was destroyed (because of a missing check).\n- Scanner opportunity card was removed, since it cause bugs, where repair ship were unusable.\n\n\n",

The web build and downloads have been updated with a version that has it working. (I also moved the restart button so that the rapid clicking that some people do doesn't make it impossible to see your score)\n\n#### 10/4/2022\nApparently I shouldn't try and fix anything late at night, the version that I fixed the Delay Instability button in was stuck on the game over screen. Both the web and download versions should work again now.\n\n\n## Retrospective\n\n\n#### Maybe don‚Äôt read this until you play the game (it is my own thoughts on how it turned out)\n\nSo I had this whole other idea for this game jam that I spent the first day and a half working on, had an awesome editor for the card system for, then realized that I had a problem: a combination of not enough time to see the vision through (I had other stuff going on this weekend) and not having enough of a vision to try and push through in the first place. So I did this instead. In the last four hours of the jam. \n\nFor what it is (A rushed game thrown together at the last minute) I am fairly happy with this one. I think that it has enough to be entertaining for the time that a review has to put into it (although I am a bit sorry for your fingers, lots of clicking). I had wanted to make a clicker game for a while anyway, so I am glad to have at least partially cleared that out of my system. \n\nAnyway, maybe I can come back to my other game idea with more time and get it finished for the Extra category, I still think that it had something going for it but it just wasn't to be.

Those parameter are expected to be a single or several decimal character.\n\nFor example the documentation for storing a range of memory onto magnetic tape (often refer as a 'saving a file') reads:\n\n```save #start #end name```\n\nAnd should be use in the following way to save the memory from address 0 (included) to address 10 (not included) into a file name 'douglas':\n\n```save 0 10 douglas```\n\nThe `[write]` command text parameter writes characters into memory as ascii values. Using:\n\n```write 5 0```\n\nwrites the value 48 at address 5 since 48 is the value for ascii character '0'.\n\n\nThe `[execute]` command uses a value of 0 as end of line separator. This is the value zero, no the ascii character '0'.\n\nThe `[blank]` command sets the given memory range to 0.\n\nUntil the system is properly configured and the correct drivers are loaded, the magnetic tape system only allows to store 16 files and limits file names to 8 characters.\n\n![rain_systems_cover.png](///raw/a3b/z/4fcd8.png)\n\n![rain_systems_screen_3.png](///raw/a3b/z/503fb.png)",

Finding the name will probably be the biggest struggle for the genre going forward.\n\nSo yeah, this one is a bit rough, not going to lie. It's one of those Ludum Dare games where you run out of time and put together the pieces at the end and just hope it kinda runs. It became clear after five minutes that the protagonist should be called Avery Ten Secondth (II), and everything else kinda came out of that. Not sure where Cleveland came from, it's just a funny name (Cleveland is a beautiful city on the way up, in fact it became so beautiful that I had to set the game 10 years in the past because today it would have been too unrealistic to have it a wasteland).

You've got that much time to cheer up your friends before you have to leave.\n\nThis is a short game about trying to pick the best time to tell your friends that you're leaving. Plan activities that your friends will like, navigating their schedules and the weather. It may be difficult to please everyone, but you're going to try.\n\nThis is a mouse-driven game. Click on activities to play them on the highlighted day. \"Tell Them\" is a card you always have, and you can use it to inform the friends available that day that you're leaving. Something might happen if you tell them all before the end.\n\nI didn't get a chance to implement some things I really wanted. I think it would be nice to have an interstitial for each activity. To really drive a sense of story home. I probably could have made more cards. I ran up against the wall for getting some options in the game. Sorry if the sound balance is off! I usually make a volume control, but the deadline was fast approaching!\n\nOne final note! I know the text is cut off in the letter at the beginning.

It‚Äôs a great engine and already prefer it to Game Maker 2, which I used to use. However, I still had to learn many things during this Ludum Dare, which would now make me significantly more productive. \nI originally wanted to have branching dialogs, but I ended with such a mess of a spaghetti code, that I was unable to debug and fix it in a reasonable time, so I had to decide for one-side dialogs only. Maybe next time!\nKnown issues:\n* Sometimes the dialog abruptly ends when you skip the last text of the dialog by pressing Space.\n\n## Tools used.\nIf you want to open the game, you just need Godot 3.4.\n\n* Sounds made with BFXR; \n* Voices made in FL Studio using VST Speek 3.\n\n* Most of the visual assets were created in Inkscape, all of them are in .svg files.\n* In some cases, Aseprite was used, projects are in their .ase files.\n\n",

Artifacts can be acquired by accumulating stats (Faith and/or Sorcery).\n\nYou start with a deck of cards. Your objective is to go as long as possible and stall the game while gaining resources and artifacts. You can either:\n- Play a card, and if you win, you get its rewards.\n- Skip a card, then it goes to the bottom of the deck and gets harder. It also improves the rewards.\n\n![printscreen2.png](///raw/bca/21/z/4a338.png)\n\nEach card has a special \"action\" which you must fulfill.\n\nIf you mouse over some icons on the game you can see a help text.\nThe only available control scheme for the game is Keyboard \u0026 Mouse.\n\nSpacebar - Clap.\nMouse - Buttons and Drawing.\n\n![printscreen.png](///raw/bca/21/z/4a335.png)\n\nIt's available on WebGL (play on browser)\nIt has no sounds/music.\n\nThere are some \"hidden\" mechanics that help stalling the game, not all of them are mentioned in the game.\n\nEDIT: The 5 possible endings are as follows:\n- End the game with less than 20 turns\n- End the game with more than 20 turns, but with less than 40 faith \u0026 sorcery\n- End the game with more than 20 turns, with \u003e= 40 faith\n- End the game with more than 20 turns, with \u003e= 40 sorcery but \u003c 40 faith\n- End the game with more than 40 turns, but less than 40 faith \u0026 sorcery",

      "Body": "*Winter approaches in the Kharon Valley. The old chief has died after a squandered summer of debauchery and squabbles. your village is not ready for the winter. Your fields go barren and your mines fail, and the call of the Tusk Beasts echoes on the chill breezes from the north.*\n\n**Kharon's Twilight** is a turn-based survival game with deck-building elements. As the new leader of your village, you must try to amass as much wealth before the tusk beasts overrun your village and your people are forced to flee the Kharon Valley. Stave them off for a time, and your people might collect enough to start a new life elsewhere.\n\n![LD50Game.jpg](///raw/c66/z/4a1f9.jpg)\n\nThe basic actions are as follows:\n\n**Plant:** plant crops for harvesting. Fertile squares produce more food.\n\n**Harvest:** collect food from one of your farms. No more than four goods can occupy a space.\n\n**Transport:** move goods from one square to another. If you have a continuous road, you can move any length along it once you reach it.\n\n**Hunt:** You can slay a Beast anywhere on the map. Hunting parties require one food.\n\n**Trade:** Exchange goods for coins, which you can use to buy Power Moves.\n\n**Fire:** If you have a Zapper tower, you can spend a crystal to fire in all cardinal directions.\n\nThe Power Moves allow extra-cool powers. You get a random set of your power moves as options each turn. At the start, you only get one power move per turn, but you can buy extra slots for power moves, which gives you more. Your only power move at the start is Despair, which doesn't cost an action but doesn't do anybody any good. The Power Moves all have different powers, including crystal mining, defense, walls, roads, enhanced trade, power move manipulation, and stimulant drugs. Explore them and enjoy!\n\nThe game is programmed in Javascript using the excellent CraftyJS library.\nAll art was drawn by me or created in PowerPoint with help from GIMP.\nAll sounds were made with GoldWave Audio and my mouth.\n\n**Balance Note:** This was an ambitious project for me for the 48 hours, and as a result, I had very little time for playtesting and balancing. I will probably rebalance it in a post-Compo version. As it is, there are some strategies you can follow that lead to boring long-term stalemate with the Beasts, which is regrettable. The Beasts will eventually win as your resources trickle away, the map spaces go barren, and the number of beasts increases.\n\n**Updates 4/3 11:30pm:** I fixed three of the informative text messages that were incorrect, which I think is fine within the Compo rules for bug fixes. There is a speed issue in Chrome that probably reflects a resource bug that I'll try to find and fix also when I get a chance (and some sleep).\n\n**Update 4/6 (speed problems):** I spent some time trying to fix the slowdown issues over the last couple days on a copy of the game, but nothing I tried worked - smaller graphics files, eliminating offscreen sprites, etc., etc. I initially felt like it must be some kind of memory leak or resource inefficiency pile-up, but I can't figure out anything I'm doing that would cause that. The CraftyJS library is usually pretty responsive and stable even with lots of resources in use, but it may be that I just overtax it here, and I'm not sure how to get around that. Sorry for the issues. I'll keep thinking about it. If you want to try the version with lower-res graphics and slightly better resource allocation, it might work a little better, but it still slows down for me.

Dying is sweet release from Wojar and the Insane One, the deity that is its ruler, never allows anyone to escape. \n\nSome come under the guidance of lesser GODs (Games Ordained Dictators), but even they have their own agenda. Will you go along with the flow of the GODs, or will you invoke the Insane One to change everything?\n\nWojar is a pen and paper table top game. 75% of all RPG elements are contained within cards and only scribbles are needed for character sheets. The game has rules. But they can be ignored. In fact, players have the abilities to make the rules as they go along. The game master, or GOD, leads the players through the world of Worjar, but it is ultimately the Insane One that really runs the game. The insane one's hand is seen every time the player rolls a dice. GOD's never roll dice. They can do what they want. But GODs are weaker than the Insane One and players have the power to invoke the Insane One against their GOD. But it comes with risks. But players can't die. But boy, can they suffer. \n\nThe download package comes with the rule book and card printing sheet. The rule book contains the base rules (or guidelines) for playing the game and the new character campaign titled \"The Inevitable End\"\n\nAs this is hard for most people to sample and test out themselves, I offer a semi-short video of a few brief examples of the very first game. This is to show case some of the mechanics, some of the humour and some of the powerplay that is available to the game. The video is a quite low quality, as it was made within the time restraints of the compo and I am also running on almost no sleep. Please try to enjoy it regardless. It compresses a 2 hour gaming session into about 15 minutes. Geeze, it really is a garbage video. Make the best of it.\n\nOtherwise please feel free to download the rule book and read through that. Or even just download the card sheet to get a glimpse of the humour that exists in this game. \n\n**WARNING: If you are offended by ANYTHING, do not play this game, do not watch this video, do not read the manual, do not download any files, do not vote for anything to do with this game.**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTGPqWMPBtI\n\n",

The player, as a musician, gets a drum loop in his/her mind and he/she is going to realize it. So in this game, you will listen the loop once and then use the instruments to rebuild it, and once again, etc. However, you can only use the given random instrument once, and change into another one.(The sequence is shown on the left side, from top to bottom) Don't worry, the correct beats are saved in the next turn. (just like a loop! =D) Realize the beats before the  music ends and the instruments run out!\n\nI've just created two levels (A and B). And I tried to use various ways to make the game look better.\n\nThe connection between this game and the topic is, the time is inevitable. As is written on the tape, I used pixelated styleÔºåwith Lo-Fi music and the tape to compose the game. I want to memorize the gone days with this game.\n\nMaybe that's a far-fetched explanation because I first want this game an endless one (auto-generated beats!). I failed because it's too hard. \n\n*You guys can play online now!!!* I finally solved the problem, after experiencing difficulties...\n\nFinally, thanks a lot for playing!

It can really make a difference.\n\n##### - In case of power attacks, all active ships from the target team take 20% of the damage made to the main target. Power attack information wasn't added, but it could be perceived if you are attacking more than 2 adversary ships. All attacks for your ships can be searched in Training stations throughout the game, as the name implies, damage made in battles are outside the normal scope and it will not affect your fleet afterwards.\n\n##### - Do not take heed on the \"type\" field outside of ship information, it is mostly wrong and does not provide any meaningful in-game applications as it was intended.\n\n##### - The 2 \"go to x\" buttons below the map do not move you into those locations, it will only show them on the map. To move you just need to press a position on the map, but beware of the fuel costs. You can buy fuel and increase tank space if needed.\n\nThat's pretty much it, the rest I think is very straight forward.\n\n### Cargo bug: The game is not removing cargo space after you lose ships in battle. To get around this bug, download a save file, search for the first instance of \"cargo\", and change the value manually to your current number of ships (if you have 3 ships in deck =\u003e \"cargo\":3 ), until I upload a post version with that correction.",

Between automatic battles, you hire and upgrade minions to stop the (unstoppable) hero.\n\n- Controlled entirely with the mouse. Remember to drag and merge units to power up their stats!\n- 4 different units (out of the dozens I couldn't pluck out of my brain in time!)\n- A random knight name generator for some reason!\n- Lightly inspired by some of my favorite autobattler (and similar) games, such as Monster Train and Super Auto Pets\n\nYou've Kidnapped the Wrong Prince! was made by Evan Good for LD 50: \"Delay the Inevitable\". This is my sixth entry after a LONG break (last time was LD 36 in 2016)! My idea for the theme started as some sort of \"bad guy always loses\" scenario, like how Bowser sets up all of those obstacles for Mario, just to have Princess Peach inevitably rescued. I figured making an autobattler would be a good way to shake off my programming rust, since it was something I had no idea how to make! It definitely turned out a bit basic compared to what I think it could be, but I'm happy to have made it as far as I did in the 48 hours! If I was to go back to it, I'd want to flesh out a lot more of the content, add more units including ones that appear later in the game. I'm also fairly certain the balance could use a lot of tweaking, so please play this as a proof of concept!\n\nYou've Kidnapped the Wrong Prince! was developed using the following tools/resources:\n- GameMaker Studio Pro 2 (with HTML5 export)\n- BFXR sound generator\n- Audacity audio editor\n- Clip Studio Paint (with a cheapo tablet!)\n\nHTML5 Version Available to play [here!](https://evanbgood.itch.io/youve-kidnapped-the-wrong-prince)\n\nNo pre-existing art, code, or assets were used.\n\nDedicated to Broden the Corgi, canonically the prince of this game.\n\nThanks for playing and congrats to all the other entries!\n\nKnown Issues:\n- The restart game button breaks some of the shop controls, so the game needs to be restarted by reloading the browser!\n\nDevelopment Screenshots:\n![Clipboard07.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49fc8.png)\n![Clipboard06.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49fc9.png)\n![Clipboard05.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49fcb.png)\n![Clipboard03.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49fcd.png)\n![Clipboard02.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49f96.png)\n![Clipboard01.png](///raw/3c6/54/z/49f95.png)",

We tried to prepare as best as we could, but against the endless waves of enemies there's nothing we can do.\n\nWe'll evacuate all people to the Capital and regroup there. Perhaps we'll be able to mount a counteroffensive, but for now we must focus on delaying the enemy for as long as possible.\n\n## Objectives\nKill approaching monsters before they reach the castle.\n\n## Gameplay\nIn this simple roguelike / turn-based tactical game, you must roam the map and destroy approaching monsters before they reach your castle in the middle.\n\nEach enemy moves in a repeating pattern, moving for several turns, then resting. The icons on the left side of the monster will tell you how many turns it takes moving and resting. Use the knowledge to your advantage.\n\nEnemies also have varied amount of hitpoints and attack strength, shown with icons on their right. Attack strength means how much damage they'll do to you, just as you'll do the damage equal to your attack strength to them. Whether you attack the enemy, or the enemy attacks you, the other side retaliates immediately, so be careful when going after monsters with low health. Even if you survive attacking them, they will attack you again during their turn!\n\nIf you need to regenerate your hit points, you can rest in place to gain 1 HP per turn. Moving near your castle and healing there will regenerate you to full health in one turn.\n\nEach enemy you kill grants you some experience points. Gain enough XP and you'll level up, increasing your hit points and attack strength.\n\n## Controls\n- left mouse button\n  - on neighbouring empty tile - move to highlighted tile\n  - on neighbouring enemy - attack highlighted enemy\n  - on player character - rest and regenerate hp\n  - on the castle (when near it) - regenerate full hp\n- Esc / P - pause menu\n- mouse scroll - zoom\n- right mouse button - drag camera\n- WASD - move camera\n- H - center camera on player",

      "Body": "In a hypothetical frictionless universe, a double pendulum is a never-ending source of beautiful chaos in motion.\n\nWhat a shame that in Unity's 2D physics engine, an unexplained bug causes such a system to lose energy rapidly, dragging it inevitably into a quiet ash-gray stillness. Fortunately for us, the theme makes this bug a feature!\n\nOnly you, the player, repeatedly feeding energy into the system by hand, can bring this world to life and hold off its fate.\n\n\nWhile this entry may appear at first to be only a toy, it holds several secret challenges for you to discover and complete.\n\n\nTIPS ON THE CHALLENGES\n (very light spoiler warning)\n\nEach challenge will show something yellow when you are moving toward their goal.  So keep your eyes out for yellow indicators and try to understand what they might be asking you to do more of.\n\nDouble-pendulums are chaos, so even once you understand what you want to do, it's still pretty tough to make the system do your bidding.  One tip is that no goal will be solvable from a very low-energy state, so sometimes the best approach to solving the challenges is to load the system up with some energy first and then try to seize opportunities.  Another tip is that sometimes a 1-2 punch combo can be an effective way to push the system into new modes, because just a single push gets eaten by friction pretty quickly.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![Screenshot-Simple.png](///raw/81b/z/49f28.png)\n\n\n---\n\nDev Notes\n\nThis is my 21st Ludum Dare, but this entry brings two firsts that I enjoyed:\n\nThis is the first time I have made music for a game, something I have wanted to try for a while.\n\nThis is the first time I have used procedural graphics. I used the Shapes package from Freya Holm√©r, which I so easy to use that I scrapped my graphics completely and used a pure-code approach to all the graphics. It also handle the text and this was the easiest \"UI\" I've ever made.\n\nThe last thing to mention about this entry is that it took the long way around. For a while at the start, it was a WASD platformer where you jumped on the pendulum, and had pixel-art graphics! I had absolutely no idea this Unity bug existed, but once I got dragged into it, I decided that was thematic and leaned in.\n\nI hope you find it interesting! I'm curious how many of the secret challenges you find, and which was the hardest.\n",

      "Body": "Hello there!\nWe're happy to have your new manga series on our magazine. Time to dive into your creativity and fish out some fresh new ideas!\nNow, a couple of tips before you start:\n1. Use Left/Right Arrows or A/D to move; use Down Arrow or S to fish.\n2. When you get an idea, you can use it on the current episode or keep it in your head for later. Both options are valid.\n3. Make sure you leave enough time to put the ideas you've collected on paper. We cannot sell what's still in your head ;)\n4. Try not to reuse the same idea in one episode. Readers can get bored, you know.\n5. You should be aware of how well your current episode will be received by the readers *off the top of your head*.\n\nRegards,\nEdward Itor\n\nEditor @ Deep Sea Manga Weekly\n\n----------------------------------\nSeriously though\n\nYou're a manga artist who just began your new series on a magazine.\n\nYou can obtain ideas by fishing and implement them into each episode of your manga. But you'll need enough time during the week to use these ideas in your manga, so don't get lost in fishing for new ideas!\n\nTech Stack:\n\n- Audio: BFXR/Musescore3\n- Game Engine: Unity2020\n- Art: Krita\n\nFix Log:\n- Fixed start button after game is restarted\n\n![screenshot.PNG](///raw/39b/41/z/49f64.png)",

There is a total possible score of 300.\n\nYou click on tiles trying to avoid the highest value target (24).  Finding 24 ends the game and your score is totaled and averaged with your previous games.\n\nAvoid finding the 0 title, finding 0 will open two random tiles that are not 24 and their scores will not be counted.  This can provide some valuable information to you depending on what tiles get exposed.\n\nNo adjacent tiles will be consecutively numbered.  So if you open a 5, the tile below, above, and to the right and left will not be a 4 or 6.  Diagonally they could be.  So finding 23 potentially gives you up to 4 safe to open tiles.\n\nIf you select a tile and the adjacent tile is within 2 value points of the one you selected, it will be opened and scored.  So if you open a tile with a value of 5 and the tile adjacent to it is 3 or 7, they will open up.\n\n### There is a Powerup/bonus icon (lightning bolt) that will highlight 3 random tiles.  These tiles will contain 2 tiles that are safe to open and one that is the 0 tile.  There is a bit of information you can gleam from this data to help you play longer.\n\nAll things considered, I'm pretty happy with this entry.  I was able to dedicate about 13 hours to it but alas I haven't any more time.  I didn't have time for anyone else to test it so if you find any issues before the end of the compo, let me know and I'll try to fix it.  I do see two small bugs on my Galaxy Note 9, the clipboard api doesn't appear to function and some of the fonts are a bit off.  But game is completely playable still and it works fine on desktop.\n\nI have some ideas for the future, for instance I'd like to provide some additional cues to the user to make it a bit less guess work. Possibly adding some additional rules to the algorithm that randomly generates where tiles are located so you can eliminate possibilities a bit easier.\n\nI didn't get around to adding sound unfortunately but I did add some animations to make it a bit more enjoyable.\n\n![LD50.png](///raw/384/z/495db.png)\n\n### Note a Post Compo version is in the works which will implement at least one additional power feature.\n\n",

You start with fairly bad cards and fight enemies to get better, stronger cards.\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-04-04 00-45-56.png](///raw/c1c/81/z/49cf7.png)\n\nAfter each battle the money counter increases. The goal is to get it as high as possible before the enemies overwhelm you, as they get stronger the more money you have.\n\n![money.png](///raw/c1c/81/z/49d10.png)\n\n## Card anatomy\n\nCards have three attributes; attack, defend and effect\n\n![card_anatomy.png](///raw/c1c/81/z/49d31.png)\n\nAttack is how much damage the card can deal.\n\nDefend is how much damage the card can protect you from.\n\nEffect is a general change the card implements on being played.\n\n## Battle\n\nYou get to play up to 3 cards each turn. The enemy also plays a card.\n\nWhenever you are ready hit the enter button to progress to the resolution screen. Here all cards effects are resolved, and their attack and defend stats are added together for both player and the enemy.\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-04-04 00-45-47.png](///raw/c1c/81/z/49d3a.png)\n\nDamage is then dealt to both player as enemy attack subtracted player defend. Same for the enemy.\n\nIf either health hits 0, the battle ends. Additionally if the player doesn't have anymore cards, you loose.\n\n# Controls \n\nGenerally navigate the UI using the arrow keys. Press space to confirm and enter to progress through the various screens. \n\nYou can always exit the game using escape.\n\n# Developer Post Mortem\n\nBeen wanting to implement a deck-builder ala Slay the Spire for a while now, and thought I would give a shot.\n\nLearned some great lessons from this.\n\nFirst is that action feedback is very important for a stat's driven game, how exactly player actions affect the game's state. Doing so in a clear and non-intrusive manner is fairly difficult, and don't think I quite did it right. Feel free to ask questions if the game confuses you.\n\nSecond is that balance is a fairly tricky thing in a number's driven game, as there many interactions which can be tough to get an overview off.\n\nBut overall a fun and interesting game to create.\n\nAnd thanks in advance for playing, and feel free to share your final score :)",

What is his secret?\n\n* WASD + mouse: walk and look around\n* E: interact\n* F: grab\n* Tab inventory (empty at first) and allows you to equip things to your hands. \n* Mouse buttons: Use equipped stuff\n\nDialogue choices are done with the number keys, or spacebar if no option is available.\n\n\n![Ravenous1.png](///raw/fbf/54/z/49fdf.png)\n\n## Author's notes\nIt's been a while! I'm pleased with the result even though it's total jank and doesn't have a proper core gameplay loop yet. But it explores the \"Power at all costs\" concept in a different way while still trying to Delay the Inevitable.\n\nGame was made with Unity. \nModels were created using the ProBuilder package. \nMaterials are basic Unity materials, some with textures made with Paint.net. \nCode written in Visual Studio 2019\n\nAudio: Cubase + LABS for music track, Cubase + Serum for consume sound, Audacity + mic for bluh bliep bla bla\n\n![Ravenous2.png](///raw/fbf/54/z/49ffd.png)\n\n## Walkthrough with spoilers\nYou can move around with WASD, and look around with the mouse. The E key is for interacting with things, and the F key is for grabbing and dropping things.\n\nStart by talking with Grampa, press space to continue with dialogue and/or the number keys for dialogue options. He'll ask you to find 3 blood bags in the room. Grab them, then talk to Grampa again to hand them in. Each time he'll unlock a new magical power for you, allowing you to see more information about the people you're looking at.\n\nAfter handing in the blood bags, he'll ask you to bring his roommate to him. After consuming the roommate, you are ready to buy spells and explore the hospital. You can buy spells by talking to Grampa again, and you can equip (some of) them by pressing Tab and assinging the spells to one of your hands. Use the spells to bring more people to Grampa so he can extend his life further and give you access to more spells.\n![Ravenous3.png](///raw/fbf/54/z/4a032.png)\n## Known bugs\nLots! It's very janky. Sometimes NPCs will wander through walls. Some will crawl on the floor. The Tab menu doesn't lock your camera. Aggressive NPCs cannot damage you yet but relentlessly chase you for easy consuming. Half the spells aren't implemented. Half of the implemented ones are untested and/or buggy. NPCs don't react to their surroundings. Where are all the doctors and nurses? Etc, etc. Yeah I know, I bit off more than I could chew :D\n\nI also didn't have time (or forgot, really) some options such as mouse sensitivity. I hope it's ok!\n\nBut still, I hope you have/had fun!",

Enemies won't attack you, but you can choose to attack them, but then you receive damage as well.\n\n**TIP**: Reaper is INEVITABLE... Escape, don't fight...\n**TIP 2:** You have health regen, make use of it.\n\nYou can let me know the furthest you got (room number) and I'll post it here in my little personal scoreboard. In case you got to the hidden (and I would say impossible) \"section\" be sure to let me know about that!\n\n## Controls\n**W, A, S, D (or arrows)** - To move.\n\n**ESC** - Skip intro cut scene.\n\n**M** - Mute music.\n\nThat's it!

It was developed on Linux (KDE Neon) system, but should be platform independent.\n\n### The game does not run\nIt's mostl likely that you're missing the needed Java stuff - you just __need to have the latest Java SDK__ ([download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)).\n\n### Windows\n\nJust double click the file and it should open if you have Java SDK installed.\n\n### Linux and Mac\n\nIf double click does not work for you then just type `java -jar DungeonEscape.jar` in terminal in the folder where you downloaded the game.\n(In case downloading jdk from link above was not helpful, look in your repos for `java-11-openjdk-11.0.12.0.7.4.fc34.x86_64` by using your packaging app like `sudo dnf install ...`/`sudo apt-get install ...` or similar.)\n\n## About the game(dev)\nThis is a COMPO entry (made within 48 hours) all by me (the art, music, sound effects, animations, code).  \nI made this in Java using my custom hand made engine (that's why it's somewhat small, but might have some problems with portability... oops).\n\n## How to play\nThere is purposefully not too many information about how to play, since I personally like that in rogue like games -- dying and retrying with new knowledge and strategy is one of the fun aspects. But in case you don't like this or want to get some things clear, here's some info:\n\n* You have health regeneration.\n* The red arrow at the bottom tells you how close a boss is.\n* Picking up bananas slows boss down (he might not have feet, but he still can slip on a peel... at least I think).\n* To escape the boss find the ladder (just as when escaping a room).\n\n\n## Cheats\nIf you get stuck or just want to have some fun after real runs:\n\n**F8 + N** - Skip current level.\n\n**F8 + C** - Money cheat.\n\n**F8 + H** - HP cheat.\n",

You cannot possibly delay them forever but you can attempt to hold these things off as long as you are able.  \n\n### Gameplay\n\nThe game is a hand/eye coordination challenge. You have to use your mouse and try to keep within the safe area while it moves around the screen. Each time you go outside you lose resources you need to keep delaying the inevitable. There are multiple levels and the difficulty ramps up on each playthrough. \n\n\n![GuardianAngel-L1.gif](///raw/c71/3/z/4b007.gif)\n\n\n### Game Design Notes \n\nI wanted a game mechanic that reinforced the theme. The best way I could think to do it was to have something that you would eventually fail. The goal being to delay the failure as long as possible. \n\nEach level is also a scenario that applies to the theme. I tried to give each scenario a pattern, sound and animations that worked together to create a separate concept in each one. \n\nEach playthrough increases in difficulty which means that you have a reason to keep going if you find the game enjoyable. It gets harder and harder as you progress.\n\n\n",

I think that the result amounts to a good framework that could be expanded in the future - the game itself is nothing special but could be a base for more (should I ever get around to it). \n\nI was disappointed that I was not able to get to audio for this game, I think that a couple of sound effects and some background noise would have gone a long way to making this feel like a more complete game. Unfortunately there are only 48 hours in a game jam, and sounds were a lower priority then having a playable game. \n\nI am happy with how the art turned out, while I of course wish I had more environmental litter to give the world a lived-in feel, at the end of the day I am not primarily an artist and I am more then happy with the results, especially the tile-map (I have had trouble getting good tiling in the past). \n\nOverall I had fun with this game jam, and I am generally happy with what I managed to create.

After the character dies, you can buy a new card for your deck. Your character only has so many lives though. After all the lives are gone, if you have 5 coins you can continue with the same deck and leftover coins.

      "Body": "![thumbnail.png](///raw/a9d/e/z/44282.png)\n\n**PREMISE**\n\nYou have to traverse very unpredictable landscape that shifts and changes with each step you take! Blocks could fly up in the air, crumble beneath your feet, bounce you up, or even make you move faster! But you can take advantage of your situation and throw rocks to shape the landscape however you please.... within reason.\n\nI'm sorry that there's only a Windows version. I used the now deprecated GameMaker: Studio 1.4 to make this, merely because I had never FINISHED a game with it; it's also the Steam version, which is no longer available (I just wanted to say that.)\n\n**THE DEVELOPMENT (WARNING: PRETTY LONG):**\n\nI've decided to update this post so as not to appear so whiny compared to the original, which can still be seen down below. It's been 3 days as of writing this update, and I'm feeling a LOT better, so I will now ACTUALLY describe the development.\n\nWell, every Ludum Dare theme can be interpreted in a wide variety of ways; well, at least that's the way they SHOULD be, but that's not the point. The point is, *\"Unstable\"* can definitely be quite physics-oriented... and guess who still doesn't know how to use GameMaker's physics system..\n\nWell, at least that constraint can potentially lead to innovation, maybe. And the idea that I came up with, I decided to make on a whim, of which I *should've* come up with more for it. I feel this game is incredibly barebones as a result of doing this idea without further planning. Really, what sucks most to ME about the game is that it's much less interesting than my previous submission; but hey, they can't *all* be winners.\n\nI couldn't come up with something to shake things up, something to give the game *value*! In the end, I tried to make a puzzle-platformer, based off of what someone else said about a GIF I had made to show current progress. But I also didn't want the player to be a static placeholder:\n\n![origPlayer.png](///raw/a9d/e/z/47969.png)\n\nSo I made the final character sprite you see in game, based off my older brother who's become 20 years old! But *THIS* is where things would take a turn for the worse. I animated a running cycle, which is one of my better ones to date, even though I don't normally animate.\n\n*But this was taking a REAL long time, and that's a no-no in Ludum Dare, that timer's tickin! I've gotta finish this animation, __I've gotta finish this entire game in less than a day! AND THIS ANIMATION IS TAKING FOREVER TO MAKE!!__*\n\nYeah, October 2nd was a wasted day for the game in hindsight. All I did was add sound effects, which I made with  my mouth, evidently, and mixed some on Audacity for the crumbling sounds. And I formally apologize for the bouncing sound effects, sorry. And then I did the character animation! Not even a single level! This is most definitely what lead to the horrific late-stage development.\n\nRegarding that \"late-stage development\", this is was originally what I spent this description on:\n\nI was getting worried SICK about the amount of time I had left, and I was starting to feel utter despair about my predicament. Everything was slowing down, my game just seemed so *empty*, and I've got **less than a DAY** to wrap it all up! I was becoming a sobbing mess from all this mental strain, it was becoming a true disaster.\n\nNow a typical person would have thrown in the towel by this point. Well, I'm not typical. I had that clich√© mindset of *\"I've come too far to give up now!\"* and continued on, even though I was literally in *tears*. Eventually I went to bed to try and calm down a bit before the final stretch.\n\nOn the final day(?) I quickly made all the levels you see in the final game; though the project file has some empty rooms, which are remnants of level that never were. I hastily inserted the character animations and fought the nasty battle of interweaving animation with game states, probably a terrible idea in general, let ALONE a few hours before the deadline. Though I got it working surprisingly well, despite the character jerking around when bounced up in the air.\n\nIt was goddamn MINUTES before the deadline that I added the end screen and title screen (in that order). I came up with the title in mere seconds, and scrambled to build the game, submit it, put the project file in a zip folder, then upload THAT, and finally get some cover image. I had *no* time to draw a unique cover image for the game. Then I typed up a whiny entry description for the game, and submitted.\n\nI felt no satisfaction upon submitting the entry. I'd have a hard time appreciating my accomplishment, given what I sacrificed to even *say* that. Going the entire way, and submitting my entry, was a mistake. It was NOT worth the emotional torture I put myself through to make it.\n\nThey say that no matter what happens, you should submit your game... well, I DID submit my game, and a LOT did happen. And after what I went through, I'll question if they ever considered THIS outcome. I mean, I don't wanna be a Negative Nancy, but we should consider the edge cases, at least *some* of them. Or maybe I'm just a hopeless situation.\n\nEither way, I'm not very proud of my game. I wouldn't mind it too much if this game's rank is N/A. But of course, give it a go if you want.\n\nAlso, for those who are curious, like yours truly, THIS is what the original description looked like. It's a good projection of how I felt at my worst during this jam. Honestly, it's kinda funny, but it also does project some real fears I still feel about the future of my participation. Also, there's a better chance I'll compile that timelapse video, just in case you're interested, like yours truly.\n\n![TheWorstDescription.png](///raw/a9d/e/z/47983.png)",

But be considerate of the forest; it might reciprocate your generosity later.\n\nGameplay: ~7 minutes.\n\n![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 21.38.30.png](///raw/046/93/z/43f52.png)\n\n## Source code\n‚ÄãSource code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dzejpi/better-tomorrows)‚Äã‚Äã. \n\nIf you want to open the game, you will need a Game Maker 2.\n\nSounds made with BFXR; one sound made with FL Studio.\n\n* Most of the visual assets were created in Inkscape. Pretty much all assets can be found in the absolute mess of a file called BasicTemplate.svg.\n* Aseprite was used for quick and dirty editing in some cases.\n* PSD files are from Photopea.\n\n",

The temperature of the engine.\n\nYou will need to burn material to supply energy to the ship. Red material will make it hotter, while Blue will cool the engine. Red provide instant energy at the start of combustion, while Blue will provide a spike at the end when it finishes. Green provide a more balanced energy level.\n\nWhen you run out material to burn, you will need to mine it from your surrounding,\n\nHome is 3 minutes away. Can you make it ?\n\nNote1: The Reboot button in the game does not restart the game.

He must be stealthy, as the demons cannot be killed, only delayed by his trusty Tazer.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n---\nArrow keys move.\n\nLeft Shift is run\n\nX to drop the currently held item\n\nZ to use the currently held item, if it has a use.\n\nSpace to fire the Tazer. Each use costs a battery, but if the Tazer is still firing when a Demon touches you, they will be temporarily stunned!\n\nPaint Cans\n---\nUse the red cans to increase your Red, use the green cans to increase your Green, use the Blue cans to increase your Blue. (they cycle back to 0) If you match the RGB value of the floor you are in, Demons will have a much harder time seeing you.\n\n\nTheme\n---\nTo clarify how I used the theme: Unstable as in mentally unstable as in madness.\nAlso, the way the level changes is not meant to be a new level... Larry Donovan does not travel anywhere, the world is altering itself around him. That's why the screen shakes and he says things like \"ooh my head!\". Probably could have made that clearer somehow...\n\n(note: The sound slider on the main menu is not bugged, just part of the vibe.)\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/b01/f3/z/44000.png)\n\n---\n\nTOOLS\n\nUnity 2020.3.17f1\n\nAudacity\n\nBFXR\n\nBeepBox.co\n\nPaint.Net\n\nwww.1001fonts.com",

I slept on it, and decided that this 1-screen infinite runner was really the only feasible choice of the bunch given that I'd already wasted a quarter of the compo time. ",

Note there are some slight spoilers:\n\n* **Moving:** you can't actually right click on the bomb to walk to the bomb, **you must click on the floor near the bomb**. [spoiler]Same with the diagram[/spoiler]\n* **Emails**: this is a game I designed thinking the player would have to endure balancing the stress from the bomb ticking and having patience (waiting for Joe to send you the emails). I realize this can be frustrating for some and I could have included something else to do while the emails arrive or include \"easy\" and \"hard\" options. **If you haven't received an email, wait a little bit more and use the REFRESH button to check your email!**\n* Bomb ticking driving you crazy? Well, that's kind of the idea, but you can turn sounds off. Open your smartphone with TAB, go to Home, then Settings.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWARNING: Playing this game might leave you mentally UNSTABLE for a little while.\n\nAs the CEO of genEnergy Inc., the top nuclear energy producer in the world, you have been taken by radical environmental activists and locked down inside your plutonium storage facility, along with a bomb. You have ten minutes to defuse the bomb until it's too late.\n\nUnfortunately, you know nothing about the storage facility and nothing about bombs... Your only hope is the Plant Director, who you emailed just before being taken, requesting help. He will try to email you periodically with tips about how to survive, you'll need to use his advice in order to do it,\n\n# Controls\n* Move by pointing and clicking with right mouse button\n* Interact with SPACE BAR. \n** You can also skip intro and tutorials with SPACE.\n* Show/hide your smartphone with TAB.\n** Navigate the interface with your mouse.\n* You can press ALT+ENTER on Windows or F on HTML5 to go full screen.\n\n# Mechanics\nThe bomb has three different modules that need to be disabled, and then you have to disarm the bomb in a specific sequence. Your only source of knowledge is Joe, your Plant Director - if you manage to overcome the unstable cell phone signal and download his emails!\n\n* Interact with the components with the mouse. e.g. if you want to cut a cable, click on it; if you want to turn on the color pattern module, click on the flick-switch there.\n\nYou will also need to make sure the bomb does not become unstable because of high temperature.\n\n# Notes\n* The game is loosely inspired in Keep Talking and Nobody Dies.\n* The game procedurally generates the bomb combinations for the three modules and the disarming sequence.\n\n# Credits\nThis game was created in 48 hours for the ludum dare 49 compo event.\n* Game design, art, music and sound created by me:\n* Engine: Gamemaker Studio 2\n* Art: Aseprite\n* Music: Composed and played by me on my Roland GP 609.\n* Sounds: Played by me on my Roland GP 609, as well as Bfxr.\n* Fonts: All fonts downloaded from dafont.com and Google Material Icons font.\n",

      "Body": "I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV lately, and had an urge to make a boss fight modeled after that game, and here we are.\n\nStory:\nYou are a fire-fighter who is sending in their robotic fire-fighting minion to put out the raging inferno inside (just use your imagination, I suck at art). The robot comes equipped with an infinite supply of water, which is a good thing because that fire is out of control!  It has also caused the building to become unstable (see what I did there?) and the ceiling is slowly coming down on you as you try and put the flames out.\n\nHow to play:\nUse the W, A, S, and D keys to move, and the arrow keys to shoot. You won't take contact damage with the flames, so don't worry about that. Shoot at the different segments of the flame wall and put it out... Once you put out all of the segments, you win!\n\nFor those not familiar with Final Fantasy XIV, basically the attacks have a red indicator that shows on the ground when it is being charged.  If you are in the red area when the attack goes off, you are hit. The animation that plays after the red goes away is completely harmless, and you can stand in it's firey goodness with no effect.  There are two mechanics that play out during the fight - A flame wall attack, where each segment will fire off a line across the room on a short delay.  The second is an increasingly more frequent ceiling collapse, which will target a random spot in the area.  Each time it goes off, there will be one additional area of ceiling collapse (and this is unbounded, technically, so if you take too long, you may not have anywhere to go).  The flame wall attack can be dodged with good timing, just don't dodge into a ceiling collapse!\n\nAnd one last thing... the flame wall segments can and will regenerate health over time, even if you have doused it (it is a raging inferno after all).  So if you don't double (or triple, even) tap those puddles (they only gain 1 HP at a time though, so you won't have to spend TOO much time).\n\nAs for the music, it is a terrible rendition of the Talking Heads' \"Burning Down the House\".  I'm sorry in advance.\n\nTools used:\n* Unity 2021.1.18f1 (Game engine)\n* Asesprite (for the graphics)\n* Bosca Coeil (music)\n* Bfxr (sound effects)\n\nThanks for playing my game!",

Should be playable now\n- Fixed broken character controller in web version\n- Fixed (or improved) mouse sensitivity in web version. Some people reported it was way too sensitive and I think this is a bug with Unity. **Let me know if its still too sensitive on web**\n- Fixed an issue with the Windows upload where the name of the data folder was different from the .exe which prevented it from launching\n\n\n# You are The Grim Tripper\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Basically, you're the Grim Reaper but you ain't got no legs, so you don't have a stable foundation to swing your scythe and rip the souls out of mortals. This means that you can't rip someone's soul out on one swing. You have to really jam your scythe into them and then pull with all your might. Since mortals have legs (and you don't) their body weight is enough to fling you around as they run for their lives, so try to fight back by engaging in a tug of war for their very souls,\n\n## Theme\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Before I knew what the theme was, I knew I wanted to make something Halloween related. My original idea was that you would fly around as a ghost or something but if you went too far in one direction, you would tip over and ragdoll to the ground. After developing the first test character controller, I realized the tipping over thing would be very boring, so I ditched it and came up with the Luigi's Mansion thing. You're still an unstable ghost-like creature, but your instability only factors in when you hook on to the living\n## Gameplay\n![screenshot4.png](///raw/826/82/z/45391.png)\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You start off in the graveyard, and you have to fly around the village collecting souls and killing demons to lower the corruption level. You are an ethereal being that can move through solid objects like walls and trees, but the humans and demons are not.\n\nAim the tip of your scythe towards center mass of the humans to hook onto them and go for a ride. Pull away from the human like you're Luigi sucking up some ghosts\n\nAim your scythe to kill demons because it's fun. Seriously, experiment with the character controller. Try to pull of some sick drive by 360 demon slicing's.\n\nWhen you kill a human, they drop their soul orb which slowly follows you. Your goal is to take the orbs to the graveyard to lower the corruption level.\n\n## Development\n\nI made everything by myself within 48 hours.\nPrograms used:\n- Unity\n- Blender: Rigging and animation, modeling, texturing\n- Substance Designer: Some of the environment textures like the terrain and buildings\n- Gimp: Creating some alpha textures and creating packed textures for use with Unity standard shaders\n- Garage Band: for the very simple looping ambient music\n- Audacity to trim and edit sound effects I recorded with my phone. There were only 3 sound effects in the game: the whooshing sound when you start up the attack animation, the knife slashing sound when it finishes, and the weird gurgle noise when you kill a demon\n\n## Known Issues:\n\n- ~~WebGL version is probably unplayable on most machines, and even if it is playable, the character controller is messed up.~~\n- Gamepads don't work properly. I got lazy and hardcoded some KB+M inputs and didn't have time to change it. \n- There is no win state. I ran out of time so I wasn't able to finish the end sequence. The graveyard counts orbs but doesn't dispose of them so you can just keep entering with the same orbs to lower the counter. (which does nothing)\n- Character has no collisions. This was intended to be a feature, but as a skill that let you pass through walls temporarily. I didn't have time to implement that, so I just skipped collision detection altogether.\n- Character movement speed might feel weird or inconsistent at times. Most of development went into experimenting with different techniques to control the character so I ended up with some very sloppy code after day one, and I didn't have time to clean up loose ends. There's definitely some weird stuff going on with the lerps.",

You don't even know anything about reactors! Well, after taking a long and groggy look at the console, you're the only one standing between an unstable reactor and reaching your destination. Can you prevent reactor meltdown while a malfunctioning AI fiddles with controls?\n\n# Goals: What to Watch Out For\nHere are the main 5 conditions to watch out for:\n- **WIN:** Your distance to home reaches 0.\n- **LOSE:** The reactor temperature exceeds the core melting point by too much.\n- **LOSE:** The core is completely waste.\n- **LOSE:** Your coolant supply is completely contaminated.\n- **LOSE:** The pressure exceeds three times the recommended 1000 MPa.\n\n# Reactor Basics\nThere's no time for everything and all of the details. Browsing through the manual shows a few things:\n## Reactor Power Sliders\nThese are the main sliders which put a load on the reactor. The higher the load, the more power the reactor will try to produce. You can see the amount of power each slider is using, as well as other power drains, to the left on the information terminal. \n\n## Emergency Control Arm\nTo the right of the containment chamber, there are a few buttons to activate the control arm. Each consumes some power. Each does some good job, at the expense of the others. \n- [**Fortify Core**] **-**Waste Mass *+Core Temperature* \n- [**Flush Coolant Pipes**] **-**Coolant Contamination *+Waste Mass*\n- [**Core Cooling**] **-**Core Temperature *+Contamination*\n\n## Pressure\nContaminated coolant leads to increased pressure. Raising the pressure lowers the effective melting point of the core. Keep the pressure near the recommended minimum 1000MPa. \n",

Try to stay alive for as long as possible as you witness the deaths of the other lifeless jars of jam!\n\nThe other jars on the shelves are purely for decoration, and to taunt you if you're below one :P.\n\n### Controls\nUse the arrow keys or WASD to control your jar of jam.\n\n### Menu Options\nPress \"PLAY\" at the top to play.\nChange the difficulty between 6 difficulties!\nView your previous score and the high score of the difficulty currently selected below that.\n\n### Scoring\nEvery second is worth 10 points. The highest scores of each difficulty are automatically saved to highscores.txt.\n\n### Things Used\n- Programming language: Python with Pygame\n- IDE: VSCode\n- Sound effects: SFXR\n\n### Difficulty Levels\n- 1: Nobody Mode - You can literally afk between two platforms and get like 8 minutes\n- 2: Beginner Mode - The difficulty is ramping up! But not by much currently\n- 3: Intermediate Mode - This is the default difficulty, it provides a normal level of difficulty\n- 4: Hard Mode - Slightly harder than Intermediate Mode\n- 5: Harder Mode - This is where the difficulty really goes up! This one is challenging to get a score of 1000 on. You'll have to learn how to jump over gaps in the platforms!\n- 6: Impossible Mode - Uhhh, this one is just, well, read the name\n\n### DISCLAIMER:\nI did NOT make the font used. It's a \"No rights reserved\" CC0 font called \"Monogram\", linked here: https://itch.io/t/214662/monogram-a-free-monospace-pixel-font\n\n### BUG FIXES MADE AFTER RELEASE\n- High scores (Best) not properly calculating. If you got a score that was lower than the actual best score, it would still overwrite your previous high score.\n\n# TO PLAY\n- Click on the download link below\n- Extract the files from the .zip file\n- Run JamFall.exe\n- Enjoy!

      "Body": "LD49 ! A BSOD that corrupts data. A cloth simulation that doesn't want to be shared. A set of very pretty animations that don't want to leave Blender. A lot of tears and despair, and six hours to try to do anything. My unstable moral was perfect !\n\n\nBut more about the game : you have encircled the enemy leader, you're ready to make your soldiers attack him... but are you sure of their loyalty ?\n\n---\n\nHOW TO PLAY : You have your cards on the left, they have an attack (on the left) and a life (on the right). Put them on the board, then pick which spot (one away, can't attack in diagonal) to attack. An attacking creature does damage first, and if its opponents survives, it then strikes back. After you've played a card, all the opponents hit in all direction, following the same mechanic.\n\nWhen a card \"dies\", it switches sides ! Yes, that's how I tried to make this fit in the theme !\n\nYour cards can heal each other if you make them attack an ally, and you can pile them on top of each other but be aware of the fact that if they were to switch side, all but the last card of the stack will flee and disappear.\n\nThere's no win con, nor anything more, sorry about that.\n\n---\n\nDISCLAIMER : As stated above, because of technical difficulties I couldn't do much, all of the game mechanics (and cards data) were set in the deadline, nothing was changed, but on the deadline the game was filled with bugs. My lack of experience in coding in general meant that those bugs took a long time to solve, around 4h today, the day after the end of the compo. As all (but one) of these bugs made the game unplayable, I'm still posting this (the one non-game breaking was a major graphical issue), but feel free to not rank it if you consider this cheating. To me, what matters is that I manage to pull back from despair and make something.\n\n",

Hope you'll like it! \n\n## What's in that game ?\n**Platforms.** *gasp* what an originality ! \nNah, like i said, it's classic. The platforms will break under the player's weight, and there's *bzzt bzzt*ers. \nThere's only **10 levels** currently, and the game automatically saves your progress, as long as you don't do some weird black magic at least \n\n## Controls\n:computer: only\n- ‚Ü§‚Ü¶ **Left and Right Arrows** to move the player\n- **Space** to jump, the longer you press, the higher you go\n- ‚áß **Shift** to move the camera around\n\n\n\n## How to play\n- Click on the [**Itch.io link**](https://flbald.itch.io/idleisbad) to play in browser :earth_americas:\n- Since it might take some time to load, you can download it directly, either with [**Itch.io**](https://flbald.itch.io/idleisbad) or with [**google drive**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MNx2Li617enyGxsLrQURDfA9svXeCfMu/view?usp=sharing).

      "Body": "![CoverPic.jpg](///raw/c66/z/4433e.jpg)\n\nIn 1983, the Cold War detente became destabilized by a new weapons program: the Strategic Defense Initiative, or as it became known, Star Wars. The Soviets hatched a secret plan to strike back against Reagan's new program. They had discovered a new radioactive isotope, Tolstoium-317, that could turn gentle creatures into ravenous killing machines. They infiltrated the U.S., building underground bunkers stocked with Ty-317, ready to turn our animal friends against us. Their goal: overthrow democracy by mutating our horses.\n\nToday, the Soviets are long gone, but their secret bunkers remain, leaking Ty-317 into our barns and stables. You need to vanquish this relic Cold War threat and save the U.S.A.\n\n![ScreenShot.jpg](///raw/c66/z/4421d.jpg)\n\n**Your Goal:** Free the horses from the threat of mutation, i.e **_unstable_** them.\n\nThis is a very silly game. The controls are simple. You can only do two things:\n\n* **_Click_** on Ty-317 canisters to detonate them\n* Use the **_space bar_** to extend control rods\n\nThe rest of the game mechanics happen as a result of these actions. Each level, you're trying to get enough energy to your drone (the little patriotic rocket thing) to move it along its preprogrammed course and up through the culvert to the horse stable. The drone gains energy from the explosion of the Ty-317 canisters. The closer the drone is to an exploding canister, the more energy it will receive, and the farther it can go. The energy is related to the square of the distance to the canister, so a canister right under the drone will charge it a lot, while one farther away will charge it hardly at all.\n\n## Challenges:\n* The exploding canisters are unstable. When they blow up, they emit particles that can trigger other canisters to detonate.\n* If you overcharge your drone, it will explode, and your horses will fall victim to the commies. It is very easy to overcharge the drone if it is near a bunch of exploding canisters that go off all at once.\n* If use up all your canisters and still don't charge your drone enough, it will be unable to complete its path, and you will end up with mutant horses and lose the level.\n\n## Hints:\n* Canisters give way more power to your drone when it is close by, so it can be good to click a canister as the drone passes. Good timing can help a lot.\n* Because the canisters explode unpredictably, sometimes you'll get lucky or unlucky\n* Some levels have random arrangements of canisters, and a particular arrangement might be very difficult to beat. In that case, just restart the level for a new setup.\n* Control rods do three things: \n  1. they stop your drone from charging, even if canisters are going off nearby, so you can save your drone from overcharging.\n  2. they stop the drone from moving, even if it has energy to use\n  3. they provide a barrier to particles from explosions, so they can keep chain-reaction explosions from happening\n\nAll levels are winnable. Levels #6 and #7 can be pretty challenging, and they can have a lot of luck involved, but careful use of your control rods can help you control the situation better.\n\n## Theme:\nI tried to use the theme in a bunch of different ways:\n- The Cold War was an unstable geopolitical situation\n- The conceit of the game is that SDI made it more unstable\n- The radioactive canisters are unstable and can go off at any time, creating cascading chains of explosions\n- Your goal is to free horses from their barns (i.e. unstabling them). Get it? Get it? It's the whole joke. Really.\n\n## Tools:\nThis is an HTML5 game that uses the CraftyJS JavaScript library for games. For sound, I relied entirely on my mouth as modified through GoldWave audio. For graphics, I relied on PowerPoint and GIMP. For three 3D models, the pipe, the drone, and the isotope canisters, I used Wings 3D. I wrote the one little piece of music in NoteFlight. I make use of two main fonts: Kremlin by Vic Feiger and AudioWide by Brian Bonislawski, plus a little bit of Ink Free by Steve Matteson for some of the graffiti in the bunkers. I modified a couple of bits of old Soviet imagery to create some of the bunker decoration visual elements, but they were heavily reworked and modded by me, and I think any of those should be fine under the derivative work rules for the Compo.",

Here goes:\n\n\u003e This is a satirical game based on the Texas government's mismanagement of the power grid during the February 2021 winter storm, a recent event in which people died.\n\u003e \n\u003e I've lived in Texas my whole life and wrote this game as an attempt to find a humorous way to express frustration with the Texas government's callous response to the event, and to highlight the conflicts of interest of many of the politicians responsible. In this game, you play as a satirized version of one of those politicians, and the gameplay can involve shutting off the power of (cartoony) citizens.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you aren't comfortable with any of this for any reason, there's no shame in not playing, or stopping if it makes you uncomfortable. Instead, if you live in Texas, I'd ask that you consider registering to vote (if eligible) in next year's state elections.\n\n__[Play it here](https://daprice.github.io/ld49-tegzit/)__\n\n## How to play\n\nThere are several aspects of this game I wasn‚Äôt able to complete during the compo, the worst of which is that it gives the player very little guidance for a simulation where the effects of the player‚Äôs actions aren‚Äôt always clear (or immediate). So here‚Äôs a brief how-to (which I wrote after the compo).\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 3.46.00 PM.png](///raw/682/d/z/43e0a.png)\n\nYour goal is to win more campaign funding from wealthy donors (the electricity, gazz, and generator industries) than the opposing party gets from grassroots support (which represents the public‚Äôs dissatisfaction with your governorship).\n\nAfter the intro in which you‚Äôll get to make a choice, you‚Äôll be faced with a winter freeze and be able to turn the power on and off to regions on the map by clicking on them.\n\n![cover.png](///raw/682/d/z/47a1e.png)\n\nRegions with a __light outline__/no outline are powered, which keeps the heat on (and restores heat to cold regions). Regions with a __dark outline__ are unpowered, and will start to get cold.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-06 at 10.53.27 PM.png](///raw/682/d/z/47a20.png)\n\nRegions that turn __bluish__ are cold, and will begin to buy generators, appeasing the generator and gazz industries, but will also gradually turn public opinion against you, increasing donations to the opposing party.\n\n![flashing.gif](///raw/682/d/z/47a21.gif)\n\nRegions that begin __flashing__ are dangerously cold, and the population may begin to decline.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-06 at 10.52.22 PM.png](///raw/682/d/z/47a22.png)\n\nIf the temperature drops below 32¬∞ F, the __grid stability__ will decline (you can influence this with your choice in the intro), which limits the regions you can have powered on at a time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre at the limit, clicking a region with a dark outline will *not* power it on unless you power *off* enough other regions first. (some regions have more population, and therefore power usage, than others, but there‚Äôs no UI for this, so you may have to experiment)\n\nSee how you do with four years of randomly generated winter storms!\n\n",

The graphics are simple but colorful.  \n\nThere are 10 levels filled with Unstable obstacles. The final level is in a castle! Your goal is to obtain the Holy Grrrrrail as quickly as you can.  The game will store your best (lowest) time so you can try to beat it the next time you play.\n\nMove to the right and collect the Star (or the Holy Grail if you can find it!)\n\n### Highscores ###\n\nUpdate: thanks to feedback from friendly players I thought I would mention that there is a timer and a high score (which saves in your browser) so you may try to beat your previous time and get through in a faster time.\n\nIn this game (as in golf) technically its the lowest score that wins.   If you skip levels it adds a bunch of time.  \n\nMy best friend's son Harry beat the game in just 577s!   ***Can you get a faster time?***  Let me know in the comments.\n\n### Ludum Dare 49 Details ###\n\nAll of the obstacles are **unstable** stacks of physics objects.\n\nThe music, graphics, textures, and code was all made by me in the last two days (during the jam).  \n\nTools: I used Unity 2019.4.24f1, garageband for the music, a simple texture generator that I wrote in SmartBasic on iPhone for the block pattern textures.\n\n‚ÄãSource Code: All of the source code that I wrote in the linked Unity folder is MIT licensed (see LicenseForSourceCode.txt‚Äã in the zip).  \nThe Graphics and music can be reused under the Creative Commons Attribution license CCBY4.0 (see LicenseForArtandMusic.txt‚Äã in the zip).  ‚Äã\n\nThe Source Code zip file is less than 15MB and is a trimmed Unity 2019.4.24f1 project.  It doesn't use many advanced unity features of Unity 2019 (or 2020 or 2021 obviously) so it should be pretty widely compatible with LTS versions.  Let me know if you have any problems getting the unity project up and running.  There is probably only a few hundred lines of code.  The way I did it ended up being fairly simple.\n\nModifying the game should be easy.  the code has some entropy in it but there is not much there.  To add a new level: copy a level scene, add it to the build list, and add it to the datadata class to say where it should take you when you beat the new level. \n\n### Controls: ###\n\n- Arrow keys left and right move\n- Space bar jumps when you are on the ground or up against a wall\n- r restarts the level\n- n advances to the next level for practice\n- m mutes the audio\n- v toggles volume between 100,75,50,25%\n\n\n![Sir BaLancelot 3.png](///raw/dd3/31/z/43b4c.png)\n![Sir BaLancelot 6.png](///raw/dd3/31/z/43b4e.png)\n",

Limited resources and environmental hazards make it difficult enough when you don't have to deal with raiding parties of mad cultists.\n\nSo, here you are. Trying to deliver one of the few surviving power sources to another settlement, when you get attacked by roaming madmen. You fend them off, but the power source didn't like the damage it took.\n\nBefore the attack, it was just glowing. Now it's pulsing with power, and the pulses are getting faster and faster. You're no scientist, but you know what that means - that thing is going to blow! Your only chance is to get it delivered to its destination, quickly (and safely!).\n\n## Objectives\n- reach the settlement before the reactor goes critical and explodes\n- destroy all raiders\n\n## Controls\n- **WASD** - movement\n- **mouse** - targeting\n- **Space / LMB** - fire\n- **Escape / P** - pause\n\n\n## Gameplay\n\nYour goal is to reach the end of the road and defeat the boss enemy before your reactor goes critical.\n\nYou have some control over your driving speed - the closer to the right side of the screen you move, the faster you go. If you stay close to the left side of the screen, you will go slower and you probably won't make it in time. Hugging the right side can be dangerous, though, as you won't have a lot of time to evade road hazards and enemies. If you collide with too many objects or take too much enemy fire, your truck will be destroyed even before the reactor can blow up.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe game uses the `Irony v1` font by [Eeve Somepx](http://somepx.itch.io/) info@somepx.com\n\nAll graphics were made during the compo.\n\n## Post-LD Update 1\n- added a speedometer\n- modified backgrounds to make gameplay objects more visible\n- darkened dust particles\n- added missing materials for muzzle flash particles",

Nothing game-changing, everything is still the same old same old, Mr. Plutonium is till running, crashing and dying as usual, but NOW! There‚Äôs a LEADERBOARD Yeah! Compete with your fellow Plutonium addicts to see who can rack up the most meterds and try to hit the TOP 10 list in the new and improved Mr. Plutonium!\n\n**Important note regarding Leaderboard submissions**\n\nDo not enter a name containing special characters like spaces and or !#\"¬§\"#¬§\u0026~~~***\\+?? etc. Keep it purely Alphabetical and numerical or you submission will NOT be registered.\n\n###### tiny patch note\nI did tweak the difficulty cure a tiny bit as it was ramping way to slowly and it could take 10-30 minutes for the difficulty to increase. This was basicly a simple formula fix, The old way went like this\n\n- I set a milestone in the beginning and when you passed 1k meterds the difficulty would increase\n- Then a new milestone would be set with this formula:\n\nnewMilestone = currentMilestone + currentMilestone\n\n- To make the game a bit faster i changed this to: \n\nnewMilestone = currentMilestone + 1000\n\n- Making every 1000 meterds a new milestone\n\n\n## Lore \u0026 Whatnot\nOh no! Mr. Plutonium broke out of his containment pod and is trying to escape! Who scattered all this plutonium around for him? How far will he get? What is even going on?!\n\nIn this game you take control over Mr. Plutonium on his grand adventure to freedom or rather his inevitable death, It's a endless 2d platform side-scroller. He's is one hell of a unstable guy, he never seems to be able to decide how to move, except for forwards!\nMr. plutonium is reliant on his plutonium to keep going. In his pod he was given a bare minimum supply to keep him alive, but over time he grew strong enough to break out! He's lust for more is what drives him. But keep in mind! He's a fragile being, should he crash into any obstacles he will loose some, and in the worst case scenario he would die if he had none\n\nSide note! In plutoniums world distanse is measured in meterds which is a measurement of both distanse and time (mostly time) and this unit is used by highly skilles athletes running marathons to determine their overall performance.\n\n#### Tips / Tricks / Controls\n- In the top left of your screen the current controls are displayed, every time one is used it will change to something new\n- you can use multiple keys at once\n- when in doubt move left, keep this one and the jump key in mid at all times and you might get far\n- there's a hard edge(invisible wall) to the left and the right, use this to your advantage\n\n##### My Personal Hi-Score in the finished version!\n![Hi-Score(Primitive).png](///raw/360/2/z/44526.png)\n\n## Techy Stuff\nAs usual I'm using [Gamemaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) (the old one) as my engine, This is where most of my work happens. Outside of [Gamemaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) i have been using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) and [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) as my graphical tools. For sound this time around I didn't have access to any instruments or any proper recording equipment, so all this work had to be done on the PC. It was a bummer(I really really enjoy making sounds and music for my games), but hey, I got something tossed together!\nThe tools i used for audio was [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) for my effect sounds, for the soundtrack I used [Onlinesequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/), never touched it before but it was really easy to get going!\nI also had to do a tiny bit of editing in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to get the soundtrack looping \"properly\".\n\n###### Credits to Nessa for making the gorgeous thumbnail for this game, the one displayed on LD\n\nIG: [aart.nessa](https://www.instagram.com/aart.nessa/)",

If it appears in green, you can build it, in red you may not. Try to think upfront, since you can't destroy existing constructions. This game is explosion-free. Or is it?\n\n\nUse your **mouse wheel** or **up and down arrow keys** to scroll up and down. The game will build new layers indefinitely, meaning that you can play it for the rest of your life. Which you should.\n\n### And of course I forgot to write anywhere in the game that your objective is to go as deep as possible, but also keeping the dwarfs alive. As soon as 10 dwarfs are dead, the game is over.\n\nGood luck, have fun, thanks for playing, and please leave some feedback ! :heart: ",

Thanks a lot for all your constructive comments! I hope you have time to play this post-compo version and let me know how it feels!\n\n## Links\n* Windows: https://biyectivo.itch.io/shiny-depths\n* Source code (Bitbucket repository): https://bitbucket.org/biyectivo/ld48/src/master/\n\n### _COMPO version: Shortly after the submission period, I fixed a number of small bugs and a reasonable improvement in performance and released version 1.1 (the first file listed, named \"v1.1 bug fixes\"). I strongly recommend you play that version. No new gameplay features were introduced. You can check the full commit message on the Bitbucket code repository listed below. Thanks for the patience!_\n\n# Premise\nYou are an expert miner who has decided to explore the Dareum mine nearby, a procedurally generated mine. You will try to dig deeper and deeper, while mining precious materials on the way!\n\nMining is dangerous, so you need to be agile to survive. Your health will decrease in the depths, your headlight will eventually run out of battery and your pickaxe will grow dull. Also, if you don't dig carefully, you can end up trapped forever, having no way to ascend!\n\nFortunately, a small table/shop is available just outside the mine entrance. Use it to sell your precious jewels and ores to repair your gear, restore your health and upgrade your stuff.\n\nSee if you can make it all the way to depth 150, the center of the very Earth! Who knows what cool stuff will you find there?!?\n\n# Controls\n- By default, WASD to move (A and D to move, W to jump/ascend, S to descend). You can remap these in Options.\n- Left mouse button to dig/mine or enter the shop/interact.\n- Right mouse button to toggle your headlight on/off (while underground) or exit the shop.\n- ESC pauses the game.\n- You can use middle mouse button to pan the camera.\n\n# Tips and Tricks\n1. Be careful how you mine! If you don't think forward, you might get stuck, unable to ascend, and you'll eventually die.\n2. If you accidentally get stuck into a shaft three blocks deep, try jumping and digging at the same time, it might just be what you need :D\n3. Always keep an eye on your health, battery level and pickaxe sharpness. Try to upgrade your light and pickaxe as soon as possible.\n4. The deeper you go, the more health you lose, but the more precious gems and materials you might be able to mine!\n\n# Credits\n- This game was made all by myself, for Ludum Dare 48 Compo, in 48 hours. I created all art (Aseprite), programming (Gamemaker Studio 2.3), sounds (bfxr + my Roland piano + Audacity) and music (I composed and played both songs in my Roland piano).\n- I used my existing template for new projects (also created by me), as well as the string formatting library I created (TypeFormatted).\n- I used the free JujuAdams's Bulb library for the lighting effects, available here: https://github.com/JujuAdams/Bulb\n- Fonts used downloaded from:\n\"No Virus\":  https://www.dafont.com/no-virus.font\n\"Poetsen One\": https://www.dafont.com/poetsen-one.font\n- Source code (Bitbucket repository): https://bitbucket.org/biyectivo/ld48/src/master/\n\n#Extra\nI will reward the first player to post a screenshot in the comments who has found the cool stuff lying in the final depth of the Earth. No cheating by modding the code!!!",

The more loyal you are to a faction, the more damage your word does.\n\n**Sow Dissent!:** Increases your perceived loyalty to the faction of the opponent you are facing (and decreases to the opposite faction).\n\n**Loyal Friend:** Removes an Under Suspicion from your hand(\u0026 deck). Click the card first, and then an Under Suspicion to remove.\n\n**Under Suspicion:** This card cannot be played \u0026 will add 2 to your suspicion at turn end.\n\n**Tell A Tale:** Push your luck by drawing cards one at a time. Each card drawn adds to the cards defence value. However, increasing the cards defense will add a Under Suspicion to your deck. If you draw two of the same card or only one, then the defense is decreased by one. You must play the card to activate the defense. Max defense is 20.\n\nIt is possible with strong enough defenses to reduce your suspicion each turn.\n\n**Please refresh to play again, some game data is not getting reset correctly on game end**\n\n![Screenshot 2021-04-26 at 01.45.48.png](///raw/8c8/2/z/3ca6f.png)\n\nYour deck starts with:\n- 3 x Tell A Tale\n- 3 x Sow Dissent!\n- 2 x Loyal Friend\n- 4 x Counter Accusation!",

If you want to quit before that, use ALT-F4.\n- Performance on low-end PCs is a bit iffy, but it's hopefully still playable.\n- Text on the last page of the credits should read \"hold RT or LMB to start over\" (not LT)\n- In-game hints are geared toward controller (no explanation of keyboard controls; see above).\n\nTools used:\n- Unity, with Postprocess and InputSystem packages\n- FMOD\n- Ableton with various VSTs for audio\n- A little bit of Photoshop for sprites\n\nThanks so much for checking this out!

Left and Right mouse button activate your lock opening and Digging tools respectively.\n\nThe game contains no sound - this is quite usual for my games, and this one is not an exception. Still going to leave sound voting on to let you guys gem more karma - feel free to rate it a 1.\n\nThe game utilizes a marching cubes algorythm to generate mesh for digable area. It is written in such a way so if you so wish you can find an exit on the lowest level of the facility and keep diffing deeper and deeper and it will not limit you.\nUnfortunately this came with a hefty performance cost. I pulled every trick to optimize the code (except offloading the computations to GPU which is arguably the only correct fix to this algorytm) but it might still take a toll on your CPU.\n\nHope you have fun!\n\n~~WARNING! The web version is NOT WORKING AS INTENDED. The map is supposed to have a mass of digable ground that blocks some of the passages. Unfortunatelly WebGL does not handle that.  You can still explore the facility and find all the miners, but the key mechanic of the game is missing. If you want to play the game as it was intended to me played - use one of the downloaded versions.~~",

For obvious reasons, even though the terminal is (*obviously*) bash-inspired, most commands feature a limited functionality.\n\n:mouse2: You can scroll up and down the terminal by using the **mouse wheel**.\n\nDuring the game you're tasked with investigating a theft, navigating various terminal containing precious information. When you're ready to make a judgement, tip the police with the ip address of the culprit. Based on your tip, the conclusion will unfold in different ways.\n\n:exclamation: **Important:** please do NOT use the **clear** command, currently it's more trouble than it's worth! I'll fix it after the jam.\n\n### You've never interacted with a bash console before? Fret not! :muscle: \n\nAt any moment you can use the **help** command to get information on how to use any other command, and you can view which commands are available with **list-commands 1**, **list-commands 2**, and **list-commands 3**.

It's a text-based adventure game with no sound, what more did you expect me to use? :P\n\nGame developed entirely by Borja Fern√°ndez (me, [Train27](https://ldjam.com/users/train27/)); and although it was only the trampoline from where to propel the rest of the game, I'd be remiss not to mention the tutorial on how to create a proper UI structure to develop a terminal in Unity by [Fouriersoft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVQGgRHtY9Vef_a254x3Lw).\n\n## Versions :gear: \n1. Version 1.00 - Game published and LDJam page properly edited.\n2. Version 1.01 - Fixed a game-breaking bug where the final nodes of the network were unreachable.\n3. Version 1.02 - Fixed the scrolling issues that made the game unplayable and made the game playable in resolutions other than 1080p.\n4. Version 1.03 - WebGL port now available!\n\n*Note: Remember to give execution permissions to the linux build before running it!*",

The aim is to go around the room and finish all the tasks without losing (which is if you damage too many objects in the room). The challenge is you have to keep both the rhythm of your breathe and the key presses. Didn't externally play test it so not 100% sure but I feel like it does add a bit of challenge.\n\nThis was the first time I managed to actually finish a game jam with a workable end product so I'm kinda vibin rn\n\nIf you look at the code and wonder \"Why the hell did he program this like this?\" It is because I was rushing and when there is rush there is no logic so stuff's just kinda haphazardly thrown together towards the end. I will pay for these sins in the manner of no Cheerios for a week.\n\nThe controls are listed in game but I forgot to put in the key for running so:\n- Hold Left Mouse button to breathe in\n- Press E to interact with the task\n- Hold down Left Shift to sprint\n\nWhen you're breathing in, you need to let go and release the breathe when the vignette turns red, I don't think I made that clear enough in the game.\n\nYou also get a bit of a buffer on how long you can go without breathe if you take a DEEP (lmao) breathe\n\nYou have to hit the key when the bar turns green during the task, not sure if that was clearly made in the game?\n\nScreenshots:\n![Ingame 1.png](///raw/23a/a3/z/3cce7.png)\n![Ingame 2.png](///raw/23a/a3/z/3cced.png)",

My first Ludum Dare, finally i was able to participate.\nFor years i¬¥ve been following this event and never got the time to be part of it.\nIts the first game i ever finished (i normally plan waaay to big and never finish anything...), and also the first game i ever made sound for all by myself.\nIt was an amazing time and i¬¥m really proud of my little game.\n\nDeeper Fishing\n\nIn Deeper Fishing u are a fisher, equipped with a \"deeper\" sonar fishing device to scan the sea below you.\nYou have your sonar map to see the area and the fish you¬¥re about to fish, of course u cant see your own hook on your sonar. But u are a hightec-fisher so u got your distance and depth meter to know pretty accurate where your hook is. Just with this, the depth meter of your sonar map and a little bit of fishing skill u have to be able to catch the fish one by one.\nAnd, to fit the theme even better, u can go deeper and deeper.\nThe deeper you go, the more money the fish can get you, but keep in mind that it takes more time for the hook to sink to those depths ;D\n\nHow To:\n\nStart to fish by holding SPACE till your fisher man has his rod behind his head, then release for the perfect throw right till the end of your sonar scanned area, you are quite skilled at throwing so no problem you¬¥ll always hit the right distance.\nIf u are in deeper water keep in mind that u have to wait for your hook to sink to the shown depths, that will cost you more time per throw, but the fish are more valuable down there ;D\nIf u see a fish turn red, u know you got it on the hook. For those pesky fish that are barely noticeable u can also look on your buoy on the bottom left corner, it¬¥ll show you if u got something or not!\nTo pull your line in just hit or hold SPACE while your hook is in the water, and be careful, if your hook hits the floor your throw is wasted. Same goes for fish that u have on the hook, if they hit the floor they're gone.\nThe last few meters your catch is safe!\nEvery fish gets instantly sold, which will give you some money (score points).\nIf your hook is not currently in the water u are able to scan deeper areas, just hit ENTER if the \"Go deeper!\" is shown and you¬¥ll fish in deeper water, but chose wisely when to go deeper, u can never turn back!\n\n![HowToPlay.png](///raw/0a9/a3/z/3c0fe.png)\n\nSource code can be downloaded from the same page you can play the game on.\nThe whole game is written in JavaScript, projecting on a html canvas.\nThe whole code is in index.html.\nArt is drawn in Paint.NET, sound is recorded and then edited in FL Studio 20.",

The closer you are to that wave, the more battery life you spend, and the more your geiger counter ticks about it\n- Your Battery is keeping you alive, don't let it run out\n- Your Battery is charged by a system of wires, which cost copper to extend into your tunnels\n- If your battery runs out, you respawn at the last wire you placed and lose your inventory (In the interest of making this jam-friendly, the radiation cannot overtake your spawn point)\n- You have to mine copper and iron to build things, which can be seen as occasional flashes of white or orange in the walls.  You can carry 5 pieces of metal in your inventory\n- Rad-slimes spawn in the underground caves, emit radiation, and want to hug you.  Shoot them.\n- Dig Deeper",

I had a player that was unable to use a PS controller and another one that couldn't use the genesis p58. Many (5+) players used an Xbox controller and that works fine.\n1. The retry button on the score screen might be placed behind the score in some browsers. It should be above the score. This issue only occures on some devices / browsers.\n\n### Fixed Issues\n\n#### 1.0.4\n1. Fixed a game breaking exploit found by one of my players which turned the game into a very easy and never ending score hunt. There were no score submission yet.\n1. Fixed the score display during playtime, which wasn't visible.\n\n#### 1.0.3\n \n1. Tato is now invincible for 1 second after entering a new layer. She was previously able to hit herself right after entering a new layer. This was very frustrating and felt like a bug to players.\n1. Reduced the amount of the chewing sounds even more. The previous reduction was not enough.\n\n#### 1.0.2\n \n1. Fixed an issue so that eating a chip now reduces hunger too. This required rebalancing the hunger values. There were no score submission yet.\n1. The chewing sound is now only played when eating two pieces in a frame rather than 1. This turned out to be neessary because palyers got confused.\n1. Solved an issue where the next layer starts before all body parts cought up.\n1. The rain strength is now part of the metrics on the final screen. This turned out to be neessary for players to understand some mechanics.\n\n#### 1.0.1\n\n1. Fixed the collision when doing sharp turns. Tato now no longer collides with her first 5 body parts.",

      "Body": "# Hole Town #\n## By Dave Dobson ##\n\n**Platform:** HTML5 (JavaScript, CraftyJS)\n\n**Genre:** Puzzle\n\n**Levels:** 7\n\nIn **Hole Town**, you play a top-hat wearing industrialist who is trying to recover gems from deep underground. Your only tool to collect these gems is the local rocks. In violation of any semblance of realism, these rocks can produce explosive bombs when you combine them the proper way, and you can use these bombs to dig deeper and deeper into the ground until you've recovered all the gems.\n\n**Gameplay and Rules:**\nMove your industrialist back and forth using either the left and right arrow keys or A \u0026 D.\nDrop the rock you're carrying with either Space, the S key, or the down arrow.\nWhen you drop a rock, it will fall until it reaches the bottom of the hole or a rock larger than itself. Any smaller rocks it passes by will be moved up one space. \nIf you create a horizontal row of three or more rocks, they will disappear, and the middle rock (or rocks, if your row is more than three long) will turn into bombs.\nBombs fall down to the bottom of the hole where they form, and they blow up the bottom of the hole, making it one space deeper, and causing all rocks in the hole to drop down one space.\nThere are five sizes of rocks.\nThere are five colors of rocks (including symbols for colorblind players or for general convenience). Not all levels use all five colors.\nYou win the level when you blast out all of the gems it contains.\nLater levels may start with some rocks in place, or you may get free bombs to use. To use a free bomb, hit the B key, and you'll drop a bomb in the hole where you're standing.\n\n![thumbnail.jpg](///raw/c66/z/3cde0.jpg)\n![Gameplay1.jpg](///raw/c66/z/3cdb0.jpg)\n![HelpScreen.jpg](///raw/c66/z/3cdb6.jpg)\n\n**Tools:**\n\nThis is an HTML5 game that uses the CraftyJS JavaScript library for games.\nFor sound, I relied on my mouth plus GoldWave audio.\nFor graphics, I relied on PowerPoint and GIMP.

[Play here!](https://www.roblox.com/games/6728852119/Under-the-Stove)\n\n[My postmortem about using Roblox Studio](https://twitter.com/ruthie_edwards/status/1386710459877838850)\n\n![under-the-stove-thumb-01.png](///raw/a45/1/z/3c4aa.png)\n\nFAQ\n=====\nQ: ROBLOX????\n\nA: You betcha\n\n---\n\nQ: WHY?????\n\nA: I'm an experienced gamedev in Unity, Haxeflixel, Gamemaker, etc., so I decided to try something new. \n\n![2021-04-25 17_27_04-Under the Stove - Roblox Studio.png](///raw/a45/1/z/3c430.png)\n\nQ: BUT IT'S FOR BABIES!!!\n\nA: Actually it's a lot harder than I expected. There's no drag-and-drop code editor or anything of the sort; it's straight up Lua and a text editor and software that looks like a crappier version of Unity. And because every game is massively online multiplayer by default, there's a lot of funky server stuff that would otherwise be super simple to do in a single player engine. And the documentation is pretty garbage.\n\n---\n\nQ: OK HOW DO I ACTUALLY PLAY ROBLOX, I'M OLD\n\nA: Girl, I gotchu. I'm in my 30s, so, basically a senior citizen when it comes to Roblox. If you're on a computer, you're gonna wanna go to [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/) and make an account, then download the game client. It only takes a minute. Then, visit my [game URL](https://www.roblox.com/games/6728852119/Under-the-Stove). It'll launch the game from the browser. You can also download the Roblox app on tablet or mobile and play it there!\n\n\n![2021-04-25 17_28_26-Under the Stove - Roblox Studio.png](///raw/a45/1/z/3c425.png)\n\nQ: DID YOU MAKE THE AUDIO?\n\nA: No. This is a limitation of the platform. All audio has to go through a manual moderation system, which takes time and *real money*, so I used free stuff from the Roblox asset store and **I have opted out of being rated on Audio.**\n\n\n**KEYBOARD CONTROLS**\nMove: WASD or arrow keys\nMove camera: Left mouse button\nJump: Space\nInteract: E or right mouse button to click on dialog prompts",

      "Body": "Hello. My name is Spencer. I am your automated assistant and guide. My purpose is to monitor your actions and provide feedback for the rest of your existence. Consider me a friend who‚Äôs always looking out for what‚Äôs best for you.\n\nI will start by teaching you what you need to lead a successful life in your new state of existence. Thousands of other trainees are receiving the exact same training right now, just like you. Together, we will all work together to form a perfect Final Society. \n\nThe basis of the Final Society is in equality. It‚Äôs important you understand that, when everything is the same, nothing can be unfair and nothing can be wrong.\n\nThere are three tasks in the Final Society. Lucky for you, they are all very easy. In the sorting area, you will place the colored cubes in their corresponding bins. \n\n![FinalSocietyPlaythrough_Moment.jpg](///raw/d03/z/4031a.jpg)\n\nIn the filling area, you will press the button when all the rings are filled. \n\n![FinalSocietyPlaythroughMoment1.jpg](///raw/d03/z/4031f.jpg)\n\nAnd in the counting area, you will place the specified number of cubes in the transparent tray before pressing the button.\n\n![FinalSocietyPlaythrough_Moment(2).jpg](///raw/d03/z/40327.jpg)\n\nAll you need to do is complete these tasks for the rest of your existence.\n\nRemind yourself that everything that you will do is for the benefit of the Final Society. If you don‚Äôt do so, the punishment is all internal. You must live with the guilt that you are not benefitting the Final Society. If that happens, we‚Äôll use special techniques to help guide you so that you can return to contributing to the Final Society one again.\n\nNothing is a mistake in the Final Society. There is no light in the Final Society because there is no darkness.\n\n![FinalSocietyPlaythrough_Moment(3).jpg](///raw/d03/z/40328.jpg)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------‚Äã\n\nFinal Society: An Oculus Quest experience made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 48: Deeper and Deeper\n\nControls: Left joystick to move\n\nRight joystick to snap rotate\n\nGrip buttons to grab + climb\n\nThanks to HexaBody VR for player controller integration.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------‚Äã\n\nThis game has only been tested on Oculus Quest but the .apk should be platform-independent. If someone with another VR device (HTC Vive, etc.) could test this for me, that would be great! I'd definitely play their game in return! \n\n*Note that the download is a .apk so it must be installed onto the device and can't be played from the computer.*\n\nGameplay video for those without headsets. If you're unable to play it in headset, just keep in mind that it's meant to be an embodied experience. If you do end up rating after watching, I'd really appreciate feedback (the more the better!!).

      "Body": "Welcome to my game!\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- Being a WebGL game the Quit Game button on the menu doesn't work correctly\n- The Back to Titlescreen button on the Lose screen doesn't work correctly. Not sure why either...\n- Not really an issue just something I forgot to solve for, but it is possible to click the reroll button when you have used them all of the dice and none are left in the dice tray. Nothing happen other than hearing the dice rolling sound.\n- The display of money isn't correctly formatted... i.e. there are no commas\n- The phase button initially say Drilling Phase when it should say End Drilling Phase\n\nPlease let me know if you find any more bugs. I did my best to squash as many of them as I could.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n*Drilling:* each depth box needs a pair of dice to work. i.e. 1 1 2 2 3 3\nAfter you place the dice click the *Roll Result Die* to see the outcome\nClick *Reroll* to reroll all of the dice in the dice tray, but you only get *one per phase*\nClick *End Drilling Phase* to move onto Processing Phase\n\n*Processing:* all of the dice in the Processing panel will be added together and there total will be multiplied by a number to determine how much money you get so the higher the die number the better.\nClick *Roll Result Die* to determine outcome\n\nClick *End of Day* to start a new day\n\nEach Phase has a 34% or 2/6 chance of failing.\nFailing costs $250,000 for Drilling and $200,000 for Processing plus and additional day\n\nIt costs $1000 * 100/200/300m depending on which one you do but you only pay if you are successful\n\n\n\n*Drilling With Dice*\n\nYou are a failing mining company who has 30 days to fine the rare mineral Ludarium, which is 3500 meters down. If you cannot then your company will go bankrupt. You start with $1,000,000. \n\nYou start by DRILLING the ground in hopes of finding something you can sell to continue to fund this expedition. Your drill and processing machine are old and have a 34% chance of failing on any given day. It costs $250,000 to replace your drill bit and $200,000 to fix the processing machine. \n\nYou have 3 depths you can drill at, 100m, 200m, or 300m. It costs $100,000 per 100m. If you were to drill 300m then it would cost $300,000. Your drill can fail no matter how deep you go but you need to reach 3500m before the end of 30 days or the mining company will go bankrupt. \n\nTo Drill you need to *place pairs of dice* into each depth slot you want to drill. For instance if you want to drill 300m then you would need 3 pairs of dice, one for each depth. \n\nA full day consists of Drilling and Processing.\n\nIf the drill does fail then you only need to pay to have it repaired but you will lose an extra day because of it.\n\nIf you are successful with the Drilling you will then move on to Processing the ground you just drilled in hopes of finding something useful to sell. \n\nProcessing just requires you to place the dice in the Processing slots. The larger the numbers then more money you will make as all of the numbers on the dice are added together. \n\nYou only get one Reroll per Drilling and Processing.\n\nYou can still fail while Processing and it will take a day to get the machine up and running.\n\nGood Luck!!\n\n[Gameplay.png](///raw/d2/z/3cca1.png)",

You can play both versions from itch.io page, or download the exact version made during the jam, if you'd like to rate it. However, at this point I already have enough ratings in each category, so I'd rather you just enjoy the post-jam version :)\n\nHaving died millenia ago, all you wanted was to rest for eternity in your cozy tomb. But nah, every few centuries these pesky adventurers must invade your private space and try to snatch some artifacts. Over and over and over. You could almost call it... a loop?

      "Body": "This is my entry for the [Ludum Dare 47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47) (LD47) Compo challenge. The theme for the event was *Stuck in a Loop*. The game I created is called Loop Runners which takes inspiration from the game of [Roller Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby).\n\nIn Loop Runners there are two teams which consist of both *Jammers* and *Blockers*. Each team has a single *Jammer* player who is the only team member who can score points. Teams also consist of four *Blockers* which try to prevent the other team's *Jammers* from scoring points. You play as the *Jammer* on the purple team.\n\nIn the game of Roller Derby, they play in periods of 30 minutes. However since the theme of LD47 is *Stuck in a Loop*, I decided to have there be only a single period and it will never end. I denoted this by adding an infinity symbol in the middle of the scoreboard.\n\nDuring the game all players move counter-clockwise around a looping track. Everytime a *Jammer* passes an *Blocker* from the opposing team, they score a single point.\n\n## Jammers\nIn Roller Derby the *Jammers* wear a gold star on their helmets to differentiate themselves from *Blockers*. For Loop Runners I decided to pay homage to his by adding a large star to the *Jammer* sprites.\n\n## Blockers\nThe blockers will try to stay in front of an approaching *Jammer* of the other team and shove them backwards when they get too close.\n\n## Items\nTo add some spice to the gameplay, I added in item spawning at random-ish locations on the track. A randomly selected item will spawn every 13-ish seconds. Here is a list of the items that are included in Loop Runners:\n\n* **Speed Boost** - Gives the *Jammer* a quick boost of speed.\n* **Freeze** - Freezes all other players for a brief period of time.\n* **Invisibility** - Makes you invisible to the other team's *Blockers* for a short period of time.\n* **Shuffle** - Randomly shuffles around the locations of all players.\n* **Teleportation** - Randomly teleports you to a different location on the track.\n* **Bomb** - Pushes nearby players away from you.\n* **Trap** - Ensnares the player for a short amount of time.\n\n# Development\n\nHere is a list of development libraries that I used for this project:\n\n* [Haxe](https://haxe.org/]) - programming language\n* [Heaps.io](https://heaps.io/) - game engine\n* [Deepnight's GameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase) - framework\n* [LEd Haxe API](https://github.com/deepnight/led-haxe-api) - LEd integration\n\nHere is a list of software tools that I used during the development of Loop Runners:\n\n* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - integrated development environment (IDE)\n* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - pixel art editor\n* [LEd](https://deepnight.net/tools/led-2d-level-editor/) - 2d map editor\n* [GDX Texture Packer](https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-texture-packer-gui) - texture packer\n* [rFXGen](https://raylibtech.itch.io/rfxgen) - sound effects generator\n* [Wavebots Editor](https://krasse.itch.io/wavebots-editor) - music and sound effects generator\n\n# Time-lapse Video\n\nWhile I was developing Loop Runners, I recorded a screenshot every 6 seconds. I then combined the screenshots to make a time-lapse video of me making the game. You can watch it on YouTube here:\n\n[![Time-lapse Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uIka1HcoIAE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIka1HcoIAE)\n\n![screen0.png](///raw/846/43/z/3550d.png)\n![screen1.png](///raw/846/43/z/3550e.png)",

But whenever someone has trouble with strange, unexplained things happening, they can always call the LUD, the League of Ultranormal Detectives, an elite organization of skilled investigators around the globe.\nThey carry photo cameras with special film, capable of capturing Ultranormal Energy at night: they take photos of things that can't be seen or touched. Even time itself has an effect: echoes of past events can radiate Ultranormal Energy.\n\nYou're an Ultranormal Detective, asked to look into a mysterious threat to a wealthy man living in a mansion in the forest.\nTake up your camera and venture into the dark night to find clues, and solve the mystery in the daytime, in your studio where you develop the photos and link the discoveries you make in them on your investigation board.\n\nTotal tally: 31 work hours\n\nBugfixes done on Oct. 5th, 21.5 hours after submission: Q didn't trigger, message about venturing further into the forest didn't trigger, and the zoom button in the studio didn't work (which was a shame with all those high res photos ;) ).\n\nIf you can't play yourself or don't want to bother somehow, here is a complete playthrough: https://youtu.be/kRz1NkmXKlQ\n\nTools used:\n\n- Engine: Unity / https://unity.com\n- Planning: HacknPlan / https://hacknplan.com\n- Writing: Google Drive / https://drive.google.com\n- Vector art: Affinity Designer / https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/\n- Modeling \u0026 quick textures: Blender / https://blender.org\n- Trees: Blender: Sapling Tree Generator / https://blender.org\n- Texture images: Photoshop / https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\n- Texturing: Substance Painter / https://www.substance3d.com/products/substance-painter/\n- Human models: MakeHuman / http://makehumancommunity.org\n- Night skybox: wwwtyro Space3D / http://wwwtyro.github.io/space-3d\n- Music: Logic Pro X / https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/\n- Sounds: Audacity + recordings / https://www.audacityteam.org\n  - Recorded an old Praktica camera shutter\n  - Recorded plastic deforming for the footsteps\n\n![Screenshot 2020-10-04 at 23.52.43.png](///raw/a1b/33/z/35bc8.png)\n![Screenshot 2020-10-04 at 23.51.08.png](///raw/a1b/33/z/35bc4.png)",

      "Body": "![crackers.PNG](///raw/e2d/82/z/35204.png)\nBased on the design choices, sound design, art, and humor common in point-and-clicks of old.  This game does play into the old style arbitrary puzzles to some degree, though I tried to limit that. So far the fastest I've completed it is with 1 loop on the counter. \n\nI am also clearly not artistically inclined. But I also limited myself to a pallette of 5 colors with 5 shades/tints for a total of 25 colors randomly generated by a bot. I did make one exception to that rule with the screwdriver for design reasons.\n\nI also tried to imitate some old Foley techniques with an older mic to try and get the sound for the intro to have that retro feel. \n\nNote: There is one serious bug I couldn't squash. If  you make the window lose focus while loading from the menu into the game it will open into a tiny window. As long as you don't click out during that load you should be fine. Also the start sound seems to be a bit louder than it should have been so if wearing headphones, maybe turn it down a bit.\n\nTheme - Stuck in a loop\nThe theme for this game is inspired by the mechanics of Minit. I adapted that to fit into the arbitrary puzzle nature of old point-and-clicks so each run you gain a bit more knowledge about how each puzzle is solved. The only thing kept between loops is your inventory and knowledge of the puzzles. Most puzzle answers are set. The only randomized piece is who the time bomber is. This game has three endings. The Good, The Bad, and the Mediocre. Each with its own unique cutscene.\n\nControls -\n\nLeft click. Click on everything. Your inventory in the bottom left. Characters. Bits of odd art. etc...\n\nStory - \n\n‚ÄãYou play as Sister Ruthia of the Cybercloth Order. On your way to a gathering where you will become one with the Allseeing, your cyber rail is hit by a terrorist with a time bomb. Being just outside its effect radius you are orbiting its event horizon causing you to continually relive the loop. There may be a way to stop it, just may take a few loops to do so...\n\n\nTools -\n\n‚ÄãGamemaker Studio 2.3, Aseprite, Abundant Music, Audacity, a case of Monster Energy, and your mom.‚Äã",

True story.\n\nGame has been made in Unity in approx 12 hours. The \"art\" took most of the time. I used sfxr for the sound effects, but as I am even worse musician than designer, there's no music.\n\n![2020-10-04 21_04_56-Just In Beaver.png](///raw/73a/43/z/356c5.png)\n\nGameplay:\n\nPlayer controls a beaver who has to catch raindrops and pour the water back into the river before it runs completely dry and all the fish are dead.\n\nControls:\n\nA or left arrow to go left\nD or right arrow to go right\n\nShould also work with gamepad, I haven't tested it however.\n\nThe bucket is emptied automatically when player is on the edge.\n\nHope you enjoy it for at least a few minutes.\n\nOndrej",

It's basically like the first section, but you need to jump 4 floors, and then just walk to the right in the end.\n\n!\u003e * Each section has a safety wall to its left, you can always walk left at the start of a section and hear the left wall sound, so you can re-orient yourself.\n\n!\u003e * [Here's a map](https://dontgo.netlify.app/assets/tilemaps/platformer.png)\n\n# Change log from the end of the 48 hours\n\n* Fixed a bug where the landing sound would happen after every time the narrator talks.\n\n* Added a build system to reduce from 10MB to 5MB.\n\n* Added a bird sound and a small walkway to the start area, so you can learn the controls.\n\n* Made the landing sound a piano with an octave depending on how high you are when you land.",

All feedback welcome.\n\n\n![SS1-FailedThread.png](///raw/81b/z/35cf1.png)\n\nA NOTE ON DIFFICULY:  \n\nThis game gets difficult!  No shame in just playing the first two worlds, checking out the start of 3 and then calling it quits.\n\nSo go play and don't even read the rest of this.\n\n... But for those who want to dig in and try to beat it, I'll offer a few tips:\n\n- You can't just force it: Once there are 3-4 enemies they can make a part of the loop impossible to sneak through, that is their advantage.\n- Your advantage is that you are always a few seconds away from victory: keep your eye out for a crack in their defense and then leap on it.\n- You can build a win strategically: There's no glory in picking up all three keys but then slamming them into a clump of enemies in the lower floor.  Sometimes it's better to wait, go backwards, or even get hit on purpose near the exit.\n\nI'm not the only one who beat this, so it can definitely be done!\n",

Destroy the enemies by hitting them with a missile that matches their color.  Beware, if you hit the enemy with the wrong color, it will duplicate!\n\nUnfortunately, you are unable to select the color of your next missile.  The firing mechanism is STUCK IN A LOOP.

      "Body": "There is very few things Non-Player-Characters (NPC as us pro gamers call them) have to fear: They don't have to pay taxes, they don't have to hold smalltalk (except when they do) and they don't have to worry about Ludum Dare deadlines. But there is one thing, one singular thing that all NPCs fear more than we possibly can imagine, that makes them say \"No, please\" instead of \"I am error\": Being on the wrong end of a malevolent omnipotent being in a simulation game. Dan Stuckmann suffered such a fate: A nice day at the amusement park turned into a life-altering event as he found himself stuck on the \"Wild Ride\" for over 50 years (in case you can't imagine the horror, that's 50 years of amusement park food). But he has not given up hope yet and has come up with a crazy plan to escape the \"Wild Ride\" even if he himself won't be around to see it anymore.\n\nSo yeah, this game is based on a popular... I'm not sure what you'd call it, a story? It's based on the popular story of Mr. Bones' Wild Ride, in which a Rollercoaster Tycoon player describes in great detail how they tormented their little men inside the game by forcing them into an eternal loop of riding the coaster (here's [an imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Wxzbl) if you've never seen it before, it's pretty funny). Originally I wanted to make it more about survival on top of the coaster, but that was pretty boring, so after the first day, I threw everything out and made it a physics game instead. Hope the physics aren't too wonky, I tried to prefer \"feeling good\" over realism but it's still a struggle. But that's what the Ludum Dare is for, right? Trying stuff.\n\nEither way, thanks a lot for playing!\n\nUpdate: Dreamcast port is live now too.\n\n![LD_IMAGE.png](///raw/a71/9/z/35ef4.png)",

I learned Inkscape for this project to make the game board, which also makes a pretty cool header.\n\nI was toying with making 2s also worth points when taken to increase chaos/give another way to push someone into having to go around the loop again.

      "Body": "I decided very spontanously to participate in this LD and since I didn't have the time and resources to make a serious game, I decided to do a little speedrun and see how fast I could get anything out.\n\nTherefore I proudly present: a snake game with the unique twist of having to go in circles around the map. The game has single button controls, just press any button to turn right. No left turns and no shortcuts allowed, you have to circle the map completely if you missed the food by 1 tile. Sounds fun, right?\n\nAlso includes a state of the art, harmonically near perfect procedural music generator (not). Best thing the music script adds is the Mute-Button in the Main Menu, use it wisely.\n\nTotal time spent on this game was 7 hours. I estimated that I could do it in 2, but considering that my usual guesses are off by months, I am pretty satisfied with just 5 hours more.\n\n### EDIT:\nHotfix 1.1 (+2h to total time), 03.10.2020, Changelog:\n- Holding a key does not turn the snake repeatedly anymore\n- Fixed the old \"Pellet-can-spawn-in-the-Center\"-fix from last night\n- Fixed pellets not spawning next to the right or bottom borders\n- Fixed pellet occasionally spawning on the last tail segment\n- Made pellets bigger to stick out of walls for easier bug hunts\n- Adjusted snake color and segment scale\n- Turned up the overall audio volume\n\nHotfix 1.2 (+0.5h to total time), 03.10.2020, Changelog:\n- Snake speed now increases slightly with increasing score\n- Fixed some random music loops not playing\n\n![snake1.png](///raw/250/3/z/34dbf.png)\n\n![snake2.png](///raw/250/3/z/34dc0.png)\n",

      "Body": "For some weird reason, as if decided by a million indies, one or more trolleys are stuck in a loop. To break out you need to manually switch crossings. Collect a crystal on every spawn spot to advance to the next stage.\n\nThis is a C64 game, so behold the retro goodness! Control is via Joystick in Port 2. Press fire to start game. Move your cursor over a crossing. When it can be toggled the cursor blinks white. Keep the button pushed for any trolley to change direction when passing by. This affects not only your own trolleys (grey), but also the fiendish ones (red).\n\nIf one of your trolleys collides with a fiendish one, it's game over.\n\nAll in all there are 10 stages of varying difficulty. \n\n\nSince this is a C64 game, you will need an emulator (for now). \n\nUpdate: A web version is online now! Controls are:\nCursor keys in numpad for moving, Insert in numpad for fire.\nNote on Chrome/Brave: Due to stupid browser policies you have to press the button on top (\"Toggle Sound\") pretty early on, otherwise there is no sound and the game slows to a crawl.\n\n\n\n![LD47_title.png](///raw/d76/2/z/35359.png)\n\n![LD47_game1.png](///raw/d76/2/z/3535a.png)\n\n![LD47_game2.png](///raw/d76/2/z/3535b.png)\n\n![LD_WIP3.gif](///raw/d76/2/z/3535c.gif)\n\n\n\nHow to use with an emulator:\nThe game binary is in the file LD47_Endurion_Loopin.prg. Get an emulator like VICE or CCS64, and open them with the file. Be sure to configure the joystick in Port 2.\n\nAbout the source code:\nThe source code used C64Studio syntax, very similar to ACME. It however uses a few extension for media file inclusion (character sets, tiles, maps). The full project file is included (LD47.s64)",

Now, time has change as i litteraly not completed a single game since.\n\nHad a lot of side projects, mainly web apps, preventing me from coding for a long time without going crazy.\nI took the choice to learn Blender / Modeling / Rigging in my free time instead of using Unity.\nAnd here we are, my first ever 3D games .. with 2D gameplay .. because  ... reasons ?\n\nAnyway, this was a lot of fun, I hope i'll get rid of my inconsistent art style for my next games.\nThis one was a pain, up to 5 hours to get light baked, and a fail during my nap time. 2 GPU crash, one time with wrong settings.\n\nHave fun and see you next round !\n\n**Disclaimer** : I used sfx that i did not create this jam : animal noise. I tried to record myself, but my mic is really, really awful, and didn't got something really enjoyable. I altered it so it's not just used, but yeah, some of my sfx are not handmade. If you feel like it's not fair, feel free to downvote my audio. If you don't care, don't judge animals sound please, as they're not from me.\n\nDon't forget to share your score, here's my best at the time of I published it !\n\nAlso, here's my favorite tested game so far : \n* [Glitch Loop](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/glitch-loop)\n* [Caterpillar Cowboy](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/caterpillar-cowboy)\n* [Roundabout Rowdy](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/roundabout-rowdy)\n\n![crasy_cow_screen_score.png](///raw/074/c2/z/3541a.png)",

Well for my submission to GMTK I submitted late and didn't get in; same here but the admins are pretty amazing.

Want to shoot that bad guy but you're stuck popping in and out of a bubble? Tough luck you can s-\n\nAnyway I had lot's of fun creating this game, and I hope you have fun playing it, I'll attach controls down below, and descriptions of all 4 abilities available to the player.

It appears we have discovered a garderner with a penchant for knot theory!\n\nYou plan to head back into the undergrowth in search of this elusive geeky gardener; where there's geeks there's organic beekeepers with lovely safe hives to live in.\n\nFind new bees for your swarm on flowers as they open in the safe, if strangely, maintained parts of the garden. If you take too long the plants will close their petals but there'll always be one open somewhere.\n\nDon't stray from the cleared loop the gardener has left us. The undergrowth is dangerous, avoid it all costs until we have enough for at least some of the swarm to survive the journey. Until then, you're stuck!\n\nAnd finally, I'm sure this is obvious but if you bump into any of the other bees they'll sting you and you'll die. They can't help it if you're going to startle them like that!\n\n##### Notes ######\n\nWorks best on keyboard. Built with phaser3 and packaged with parcel.\n\nI know it's just snake with different maps but I was stuck for ideas, my girlfriend was sick etc. so I'm just happy to have made something and looking forward to reviewing everyone else's games.\n\n##### Patch Notes #####\n\n2001262a60: Fixed an issue with pausing where the user could easily get pause-locked.\n\n##### POST LD Fixes #####\n7df8a05dae: More significant fix to death and respawning, now you keep your bees when you die. Level thresholds have also been reduced to do-able levels.

I used phaser.js as a framework and the game is controlled only by mouse.\n\n![rollYourDough01.png](///raw/16b/z/35912.png)\n\nThis time, i finished right in time, but of coursse I had to drop some features i originally wanted to have.

In each solar system you must populate each planet in the solar system in order to escape being * *stuck in a loop* * of the orbits‚Äã of the planets.  There are ten Solar Systems (ten levels) and then you win!\n\n\n![ActionShot1.png](///raw/dd3/31/z/36199.png)\n\n\n## Single Button Controls ##\nThe only control is the spacebar to launch (also the 'x' key and left shift) and hold to launch longer.   Your job is not complete until you are done populating all of the planets so if you hit the forcefield on the outer edge of the solar system you will be stopped and turned around so you can go back in and finish the job.   \n\n\n![ActionShot2.png](///raw/dd3/31/z/361a1.png)\n\n\n## Get The Lowest Times ##\nPost your high scores in the comments below!

The post compo version is up on itch.io and includes the following changes:\n- set the cursor to be confined to the games window\n- hid the cursor when it was not used\n- forgot that I had used a sprite from the internet as a placeholder and replaced it with a sprite created by me\n- tree puzzle is solvable from both sides and slightly easier  \n- fixed a few bugs (rain audio loop, player sometimes looking away from an interaction, end-sequences of point'n'click puzzles buggy)\n- some visual improvements (scattered rocks and grass, level border, player walk animation. a little UI polish)\n- hammering home the message of the perspective puzzles by adding text at their end  \n\nThe compo version is still up on itch.io, so it's up to you to decide whether to play and rate based on that version or try out the smoother post compo version and take the changes noted above into account when rating the game. :)  \n\n**~ A fun little story from during the jam ~**  \nI sculpted all my models in Blender using a constant detail value of 30, which I believe is quite high, but it just allows me more flexibility, I feel (I'm still a total noob, so any advice is appreciated). So I sculpted the tree for the game and Blender started lagging. I checked the faces-count and it was at a whopping 2.3 million. After applying a 0.01 decimate modifier the lag was gone (and the tree also looked slighty better, less smooth), but I had already saved the .blend file before inside my Unity project and therefor inside my repo. And I had commited, but not pushed that file, which was 140mb large. When trying to push, I noticed that GitHub only supports file sizes up until 100mb (which is quite high already I guess). So in the end I also had to reset my repo. And I will never put .blend-files directly into my projects again (.fbx seems smaller anyway and also there was a bug with Unity and .blend-files that prevented multiple animations from being imported). Lesson learned :)\n\n**~ Parting words ~**  \nThis jam was just great and I'm kinda in love with how the game turned out ^^. Looking forward to playing a ton of games in the upcoming weeks!  ",

There are instruction modals in the game, but just in case: \n\nGameplay is split into two phases. In the overworld, you must choose a castle to travel to from your current castle (which will have a blue marker around it). Once you've chosen a castle, a red marker will appear underneath it. You can then travel by clicking the \"travel\" button in the left-hand pane. \n\nTravelling takes 1 day. You have to survive for 14 days. \n\nWhile travelling, you enter the other phase of the game. You are underground and must choose a route through a sequence of cards which will affect your status and the status of the tunnel you're in. You choose from the top row of cards, again using the mouse. Depending on your last choice of card, between 2 and 3 of this top row will be selectable. Cards not adjacent to your previous position will not be selectable. \n\nThe goal overall is to keep the network of tunnels healthy and also not die yourself. At the end of every turn, the network will suffer random damage which it is your job to repair.\n\n### Theme \n\nI went with this design because the theme reminded me of the [keep-alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) HTTP header, so I wanted to create something that was kind of HTTP but not really. In this game, you are keeping a network alive. \n\n### Details\n\nThis game was made using [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/) and my own tool for procedurally making sprites, [pixel-factory](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/). \n\nI like pixel-factory because it lets me keep writing JavaScript all the way through the jam without breaking flow and changing to another tool. You can see an example [here](https://pixel-factory.surge.sh/#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) -- this is the worm card used in-game.\n\nI'm pretty happy with the results (it's the first jam I've used it for). Generally I think sprites went well with a couple of notable exceptions (health bars in the tunnels, probably a few others). \n\nI didn't get around to audio and wish I had now -- next jam I need to write less code and use more tools! \"amount of source code produced\" and \"how fun the game is\" are pretty much completely unrelated :smile: \n\nThanks for playing and reading, I appreciate it! \n",

You don't want them hanging around.\n* Get even bigger. There is nothing stopping you. Only rule, stay alive!\n\n### Resources\nThe three resources are water, nutrient, and sun. If any three of these reach 0 your tree will start to die. Be extra careful with nutrient, it is essential to expand and it is impossible to obtain it again if you run out.\n\n### Building\nTo start building roots or branches, press the build button located on the top of the screen. Then, use your mouse to select a starting location. This location must be on the tree. Next, pick an ending location. This location will be the point the branch will grow out to. If the line is red, it can not be built. The amount of nutrient required to build is shown next to your cursor.\n\n*Note: Branches can't go down and roots can't go up.

The implementation of a difficulty slider was also new, and definitely makes a difference in the game.* \n\n*Regretting no sound, and more visibility on gene helix would have been better.*\n\n*My scene changing has some small issues, so if you happen to fall out of the world, sorry! And, a refresh should fix. Another minor issue, depending on resolution, if a button goes out of view when playing full screen, resizing will bring it back.

This might sound easy at first, but it is not - and to be honest, I haven't done any programming for years (and didn't participate since LD17) so was a bit rusty to say the least.\n\nThe results; a simulator with questionable graphics, questionable sound, questionable game mechanics - but hey! - That is the results of my priorities in life!\n\nThanks for showing interest :)\n// Sune\n\n--\n\nThe GAME!\n\nThe concept is simple (and displayed on the beautiful non-virus intro page): balance the important measurable parameters in your life (the top 5 bars) by working with what you can spend your time on (the left 7 bars) - and hey!!!! you!!! - don't cheat looking up my scoring matrix and stuff in the source code!\n\nThe activities on the left helps you either increase or decrease the bars on the top.\n\nYou prioritize morning, midday, afternoon, evening and night (the five squares on the left). You can drag the squares to prioritize what you want to spend your time on with the consequences that follow.\n\nOnce in a while, like in any interesting life, events do happen! - When an event happens you have to deal with it - whether you want it or not - your life simulation cannot continue until then.\n\nThe game gets increasingly harder (basically since you have more plants to care for) so try to see how many days you can survive!\n\nGood luck.\n\n--\n\nThe source code is on GitHub and the game is based on Phaser.io and javascript.",

In this game, you defend your campfire from the \"corruption\", glitchy ice monsters who HATE your fire.\n\n# HOW TO PLAY\n\nYou need to keep your campfire alive. Enemies will head straight for your fire from all angles, ignoring you completely. To defeat an enemy, smack it with your torch. Use your jetpack to move around the tundra quickly. If an enemy gets close to your campfire, a warning will appear on your screen to let you know.\n\nDestroying an enemy will increase your combo meter.  Keeping your combo streak going is the key to getting a high score. Occasionally, you'll need to stray far from your fire to keep your meter up. If you're in a situation where you don't think you can make it back to your fire in time to save it, you can transfer your campfire to a new location by burning a tree down, though this will clear your multiplier.\n\nHave fun, and thanks for playing!\n\n# CONTROLS\n\n- **WASD** - Movement\n- **Space** - Use jetpack\n- **Left mouse** - Swing torch\n- **Right mouse** - Burn tree, convert to campfire\n- **P** - Pause\n- **Esc** - Exit game\n- **1** - Switch between fullscreen/windowed.

      "Body": "Well. You are a simple man, with simple taste. You love your flower pots out in the sun. But it's hot. Like **REALLY hot**. So you have to constantly **water your plants** so they don't die. You gain points by **keeping your plants alive** and lose points by letting them die (not taking into account the emotional damage of seeing your plant buddies **WILT IN THE SUN!**). Make sure to **refill** your watering can often so you **don't run out of water.**\n\n## Multiplayer Mode:\nThis mode is ***REALLY*** the most fun / heart of the game. It can even get quite tactical, but PLEASE don't let it end like the average game of \"Mario Party\"...)\n\nPlants belong to the person who last watered it. This means they grant points to this player while alive, but also deduce points when dying. Try to score the most points by shoving and keeping the other player from watering and keeping your own plants alive.\n\n## Controls:\n\n**Player 1:**\n* **Directional movement:** w, a, s, d | D-Pad | Left-Stick\n* **Spill water from your watering can:** space | a-button\n* **Shove the other player:** left shift | b-button\n\n**Player 2:**\n* **Directional movement:** arrow-keys | D-Pad | Left-Stick\n* **Spill water from your watering can:** right shift | a-button\n* **Shove the other player:** keypad-0 | b-button\n\nSelect stages by clicking on them. Return to menu by pressing Escape. **Gamepad support** is through SDL2. All major gamepads like 360 should work. My crappy age old ps1 ripoff controllers worked :-D\n\n# [**PLAY THE GAME AT ITCH.IO**](https://vector-wolf.itch.io/extreme-garden-simulator)\n\n## Tools:\n\nThis game was made with my very own handcrafted **C++ 2D Game Engine**, called the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine). The **Web Build** is brand new and should work now somewhat reliably. I didn't know that even gamepads work with browser nowadays. That's what I call magic :sparkles:\n\nI made all the pixel art with [Krita](https://krita.org/en/). All sound effects are made with my mouth, recorded and cut with [Audacity](https://www.audacity.de). The music was done with the awesome [LMMS](https://lmms.io) using only its gameboy sound. The map was built wit the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) and my IDE of choice is [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org).\n## Stage 1\n![stage1.png](///raw/8c0/82/z/33112.png)\n## Stage 2\n![stage2.png](///raw/8c0/82/z/33113.png)\n## Stage 3\n![stage3.png](///raw/8c0/82/z/33114.png)",

Sorry! :sweat_smile: \n\n![Screenshot_2020-04-20_08-33-36.png](///raw/9b/z/2d183.png)\n\nThe goal is to _keep the patch of flowers, and the bees alive_ for as many turns as possible.\n\nBunnies\n---\n\n- ... eat flowers.\n- ... will move 1 spot every turn.\n- ... prefer to move to a flower (and eat it), but otherwise move randomly.\n- ... start with 2 hp. (This can be seen if the blue cursor/indicator is over them in the lower right corner.)\n- ... can be stung by a bee, and will loose a hp. Also, this'll kill the bee. (So, need to be stung twice to be removed from play.)\n- ... will spawn every 11 turns, in one of the holes.\n\nFlowers\n---\n\n- ... get eaten by bunnies.\n- ... need to be there in both kinds, otherwise it's game over.\n- ... will 'split' (reproduce) into one pink and one white one, if brought pollen of the _other_ color. (The original flower will then dissappear.)\n- ... the player can choose the location of the pink flower when split, the white one will spawn on the opposite side of the selected hex. (Unless there isn't an empty flower pot there!) That is, the cursor/indicator will turn pink for the placement of the pink flower, and there'll be a corresponding white indicator on the opposite hex _if the white one can be placed_.\n\n\nBees\n---\n\n- ... can pick up pollen from a flower. (This is the white or pink colored diamond icon in the lower right corner, if the cursor is on a bee.)\n- ... can only pick up one type of pollen at a time. (The other type will be erased.)\n- ... will 'split' (reproduce) a flower when carrying pollen from the opposite color instead of taking pollen.\n- ... each can move once per turn. This uses up nectar. If a bee can't move any more that turn, the arrow in the lower right will turn into a stop-sign.\n- ... start with 5 nectar. (See the lower right corner if the cursor is on a bee.)\n- ... die when out of nectar.\n- ... can fully refill nextar at a hive (or not lose one the turn they gather pollen, but _not_ when splitting a flower).\n- ... will spawn every 9 turns, at one of the hives.\n- ... can attack a bunny for 1 hp, but will then die.\n\nIndicators\n---\n\n- ... are blue and floaty to indicate that they are the hex the cursor is now on.\n- ... are green when when they indicate that something can be selected.\n- ... are red when they indicate that a bee can attack a bunny.\n- ... are pink when a bee can visit a flower of that color _or_ when splitting a flower, indicate where the pink offspring flower is going to be.\n- ... (the same goes for white...)\n- ... are blue (and not floaty) when a bee can go to a hive to refill nectar.\n\nHow many turns can you last?",

When they wither to their smallest stage (sapling), they die. If one plant dies, you lose the game.\n\nA sure way to win is as follows:\n\n1) Water both plants immediately, once each. They should both grow, because they are born without thirst. If the second plant that you watered does not grow, water it again: it has become thirsty in the meantime.\n\n2) Choose one plant to focus on, and keep watering it. The second plant should be watered occasionally, but if it withers it MUST be watered as soon as possible. The taller the plant is, the more it can survive without water.\n\n3) Keep doing this once the chosen plant has fully bloomed. At this point the plant will be able to survive without water, so feel free to focus on the one you have neglected.\n\n4) The second plant will also bloom thanks to your care. Congratulations, you have won!\n\n\n\n:warning: ** SPOILER END ** :warning:",

It's not really about dating, and it's not really endless, so it's more of a finite-relationship-simulator. But endless dater sounds cooler, so let's go with that! Also to foreshadow one of the earlier questions, the Ludum Dare deadline ate my sound effects.

      "Body": "_ Hello fellow Developers and Gamers!_ \n\n**First** let me start with this! I was aware about **Ludum Dare** for a long time, but I never participated in it. That changed this weekend :smile: ! I finally decided to give this event a go and to try to develop a game in Unity! I have messed around with Unity before, but I never managed to \"produce\" something. That changed today as I've just \"finished\" my first \"game\" in it -\u003e **Keep E.T Alive**.\n\nSo as name of the game suggest I **followed** the idea of the **theme** ... perhaps too much :smile:. E.T has returned from his home planet back to Earth. He realized that he is missing some of the finest things from Earth - such as _Beer_ or _Meat_. But he is very exhausted from the trip so you need to keep him alive! Feed him, don't let him be thirsty and also clean after him. He may occasionally start to bleed as he is adjusting to earthly atmosphere again, so take care of that too!\n\n![e.t.png](///raw/d4b/03/z/2c447.png)\n\nFew **Notes** from my development process:\n- **Graphics** - First I wanted to go with pixel-art, but I quickly realized that I will not have time for it as I'm not very - good at drawing it (it's something I definitely want to improve on in future). So I decided for super fast solution -\u003e MS Paint. All Sprites were drawn with it, hardest part was E.T itself as I had to combine different shapes, in different angles and sizes. I used GIMP for adding transparent layers.\n- **Code** - In my professional life I am front-end React developer so when I realized that I can just use VSCode I was super happy! I set up few things, configured some extensions and I started coding right away! I learned a lot as this was basically my first project in Unity (they made their docs really easy to read). One thing that helped me a lot was plugin iTween recommended by a friend.\n- **Audio** - This might have been my favorite part. I laughed whole time as I was creating and editing those sound effects. Good thing that I had that beer in fridge and also duck tape.\n\nThings that I would **improve or change**:\nBiggest problem was the time. There are a couple of things that I really wanted to add to the game but I just didn't have time.\n1. **Animations** for E.T - right now E.T looks super blunt and it worsens overall feeling from the game. I wanted to add expressions to his face when beer was close to his Infusion or face of guilt when he would poop himself.\n2. Another **Need** for E.T - there was a plan to add one more item iPhone with airpods. Player would have to give E.T airpods to both ears and then start song on iPhone (it would also change game sound loop) and than when E.T would have enough of listening, remove them and stop the song.\n3. Better **music** - game sound loops were the last things I worked on and it shows. I used this web app https://beepbox.co/ to create some songs but I am really not happy with outcomes. I felt like my head wanted to explode at some point.\n\nOverall I am super happy that I did this. I learned a lot, got nice experience and mainly it was **super fun**. I definitely will try next Ludum Dare! Heck, I might start working on some other game in meanwhile just because I might feel like it!",

That's why you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nStart as a tiny flame and consume logs to get bigger. Avoid cold and water, otherwise you're going to have to start over while your fire source gets weaker. Share the gathered flame with the bonfire to keep it burning. \n\nWhat are you waiting for?

You motivated me to work more on the game and improve it. Archives with a post-jam version of the game are available on itch.io. The following things were changed:\n- Log respawn rates were adjusted to avoid player collecting only logs near the bonfire.\n- The level design and game parameters were adjusted to make the game more interesting.\n- Chill difficulty mode was added for those who don't like to die and just want to go through the experience in a calm way.\n- Challenging difficulty more was added for those who want to use their agility and ingenuity to complete the game while still not sweating too much. I recommend to start with this one.\n- Die a Lot mode was added for those who would like to test their platformer skills. It's hard but it's doable.",

Players actually draw pictures according to assigned themes and constraints. Beginners can practice the most important part of drawing, actually drawing things, without worrying about the quality of their art, while long time hobbyists and/or professionals can practice working with specific constraints. This game is a formalized version of an exercise I used to do for fun where I would attempt to draw things in Microsoft Paint with one minute time constraints.\n\n### But I'm not an artist!\nI'm not either, but it doesn't mean you can't draw! Everyone can draw. You just need to start doing it and practicing.\n\n### But I'm an artist!\nGreat! You can practice techniques you normally wouldn't use in an environment that you're perhaps not familiar with.\n\n### What do I need to play?\nAt minimum, you just need something to draw with and something to draw on. Any style or medium works, whether it's something you're intimately familiar with or some crazy new set up you've never tried before. However, it is also recommended to have friends to play with, either in-person or online. Drawing with friends is great fun.\n\n## Post-Mortem\nThis is the first time I've ever competed in the Compo. I ended up starting very late because I was busy on the first day, and had no ideas to run off of until the night of the second day. I spent less than 24 hours making this game, but I'm very happy with the result as a whole, even if it is a very simple concept and system. This is the first time I've ever made a game that genuinely feels like something that is fun to play on a somewhat regular basis. Hopefully you can enjoy practicing drawing by playing Draft \u0026 Doodle!",

There is not a single tree.\n\nYou have to manage your forrest to protect it from the human lumberjacks. Choose the right trees to plant. You will have to expand to survive. Make sure, that you have always enough water. Plant strong trees to hold back the heavy machines that come the human cities.\n\n![Screenshot-1.PNG](///raw/546/22/z/2642e.png)\n\n![Screenshot-2.PNG](///raw/546/22/z/26430.png)\n\n![Screenshot-3.PNG](///raw/546/22/z/26431.png)\n\n![Screenshot-4.PNG](///raw/546/22/z/26435.png)\n\n\nHow to play:\n- You can only plant trees on the grass.\n- To expand the grass area, you have to plant the \"Tree Of Life\". It will spread out the grass.\n- To plant trees, you need water. The \"Deep Root Trees\" will extract water from the ground.\n- To attack the lumberjack machines, you can use the \"Spike Tree\". But they cost you one water per month each.\n- Spike trees have not so much health. You can protect them with \"Hard Wood Trees\". The spikes can still attack, if there are other trees in front of them.\n- If you don't have water, your Spike Trees won't attack.\n- When your trees are not attacked by lumberjacks, they will heal - or even grow, if they are healthy.\n- Try to survive as long as possible.\n- To win the game, you have to destroy the cities to the left and right with your spike trees.\n- If there is no tree and no grass left, you have lost.\n\n\n*For the source file use ZIP the password \"LD45\".*\n\n*I released version 1.2 as Post-LD-Version, where I decreased the difficulty a little bit and added some tiny new features.

You are a robot that wakes up with no memory, abilities or purpose, and need to figure out everything on your own.\n![25.png](///raw/5d0/72/z/2982d.png)\n# Exploration\nIn exploration mode, you need to navigate a maze of trees using the arrow keys. You can find hidden messages by both sides, explaining the story and helping you figure out your purpose. You can also fight both robots and humans by touching them.\n![16.png](///raw/5d0/72/z/29830.png)\n# Combat\nIn combat mode, you need to defeat your enemy before they defeat you. You start the game with no attacks, but early on you get a special scanner that allows you to scan enemy attacks and copy them. Use this ability to get a variety of attacks, and eventually defeat one of the final bosses.\n![34.png](///raw/5d0/72/z/29832.png)\n# Useful information\nIf you're stuck or unsure how things work, use this section for additional information:\n- Energy and health recharge after each battle.\n- You need energy to attack. Use \"Wait\" to get 5 energy.\n- Attacks deal 'attack power + your power - enemy defense' damage.\n- If you run or lose, you will return to the starting position. You will keep your level and attacks, but not ones scanned in the battle you just lost/ran from.\n- After failing to defeat an enemy, that enemy will display its name above its head in exploration mode. Use this information to avoid fighting the same enemy over and over again.\n\n```\nChangelog:\n1.0.2:\n-Reduced the difficulty (some enemies are now weaker)\n-Fixed another name\n1.0.1:\n-Removed placeholder cube graphics             \n-Fixed player discharge animation          \n-Fixed some typos and names         \n1.0.0:\n-Initial version\n```",

(the collision is abit bugged on the hook, a simple change but time)\n\nwhen you feel satisfied with the game, press alt + f4 to exit the game.   didnt make a exit button :dog: \n\n\n\nfeel free to completely destoy me in the comment section, feedback is always welcome either good or bad.\n\n\n",

Use your skills as a master builder to reach them and pave your way through the chasm and into freedom.\n\nPS: If you beat the final level, could you please share in the comments a screenshot of the path you built towards the goal before reaching for the stairs? I'm really curious to see how players approach it :smile: \n\n## Controls:\n\nGame should work using keyboard or gamepad devices. For the gamepad button names I'm assuming an Xbox-like controller.

      "Body": "A puzzle game based on constellations from stars that emerge from a singularity. Your goal for each level is to construct a repeating constellation pattern that can link all the stars. \n\nThere are three main types of controls. Click on one to activate it, and then all of them use left-right mouse motion to do what they do (rotate, bend, scale). There are also switcher buttons that you can click on when they appear later on.\n\nThe game is available here: http://planktongames.com/ld45\n\nWhen thinking of starting with nothing, I went with a Big Bang theme, because before the Big Bang, there was nothing anywhere else other than the central singularity. So, each level starts with empty space, and then you explode all matter into it, and then you can play. Admittedly, the astronomy is more than a little suspect here, but the game is the point of it rather than the science, after all.\n\nGuide: \n\n- When \"Detonate\" comes up, click on the singularity to explode it.\n- When \"Constellate\" comes up, click on the controls on the bottom to link stars into patterns.\n- When \"Tesselate\" comes up, you've solved the puzzle, and all stars are reachable from your repeated pattern. (You don't need to do anything here.)\n- When \"Concentrate\" comes up, all matter in the universe is compressing into a new singularity for you to detonate. (You don't need to do anything here.)\n\nThere are 21 levels in all (you start from level zero, of course, because you start from nothing).\n\nWritten in Unity. All sound is from my face recorded and processed in GoldWave Audio. Art was made in PowerPoint and GIMP. Font is Trench by Nima Type (https://nimatype.co/), which is free and very cool.\n\n![lvl5.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26967.jpg)\n![Title.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26970.jpg)\n![lvl3.jpg](///raw/c66/z/2696d.jpg)\n![lvl1.jpg](///raw/c66/z/26972.jpg)\n",

One would say that's a doughnut, but to them I would reply \"You do not understand the metaphysical structure of the universe\".\n   \nTo explain the universe, we cannot really start from somewhere, as there is no beginning. Actually, there is nothing at all. No space, no void, and no time. But that begs a lot of question \"Can we really say that something exists or does not exist somewhere?\" and \"Where is that somewhere?\".

If you click on an empty square, it will open a menu to craft a new card **and that's where those bonuses come in handy**. \n\n- Once crafted, a card can be used in fight, and that's it /o/\n\n\n**Craft card**\n![Screenshot1.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d0.png)\n\n**Improve cards**\n![Screenshot2.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d4.png)\n\n**And fight!**\n![Screenshot3.png](///raw/77f/8/z/273d7.png)\n\n\n## Big Takeways\n\nIt was hard. \n\nLike, very hard. \n\nIt's very, very much a system game, with a lot of intricate elements. It's absolutely what I wanted to do though, because I usually do more narrative games, or simple puzzle games, so I underestimated the difficulty. As a result, there's a lot I couldn't do, since I just got to the point of a kinda playable state 30mn before the deadline.\n\n\n**Content**\n\nThe content is... poor. It's very frustrating, because building the system was obviously the hardest part, by far, and now that it's built, adding content is a lot easier. (Not adding bugs in the process would probably be a bit more challenging, but I hope the system is overall pretty safe.) \n\nIn a card crafting game, you'd expect to... be able to craft a lot of things, right? Well, too bad, there are only 3 different bonuses available. Would I have had two more hours, I may have been able to add maybe 1 or 2, and just that would have exponentially raised the amount of possibilities. \n\nBut well, it's 48h, no more, that's the fun /o/\n\nI still managed to multiply the variety of enemies by 9 during the last half-hour. (Ok, there are only 9 enemies, and 3 different sprites in total. DON'T BE MEAN.)\n\n\n**Polish**\n\nIt's... dry. I love polishing, doing small feedback and FX everywhere. \n\nI couldn't. I hope there still is some fun in there.\n\n\n**Sound**\n\nUh, that one hurts a lot as well. I love composing music, and doing small sounds. \n\nThere is... no sound in the game x_x\n\n\n**Visuals**\n\nIt's exceptionally poor as well, but at least there's nothing surprising about that for me. I'm a programmer. It's programmer art.\n\n\n**UI**\n\nDamn, thinking the UI for such a game was quite a challenge. I lost a lot of time just trying to figure out how to present the elements in a readable way that could be understood. I think the result is ok-ish?\n\n",

And here is the result after precisely 22h of work and watching tutorials.\n\nIt was really fun to create a whole project cycle solo. Even those few sounds I added created using an audio recorder. xD\n\nActually I have started creating the game with visual code, but feeling not comfortable enough with it, I moved to common scripts in the middle of the jam.\n\nAs a result I have not much of gameplay. Even this katana feature was implemented to support the theme at least in some way.\nBut I am not a code guy totally, so even so this result is a small personal achievement for me.\n\nI had a learning goal, and I achieved it. So I am proud of it. :3\n\n**[Here I will add some tutorial links I used during the jam soon]**\n\n**P.s.** To be very honest, before updating LD page I fixed a crystal feature (noticed it is not adding speed in the morning) and added death animation on character (same as on monster). I took me 15 minutes out of the jam.\n\nOh, just noticed I accidentally added a death animation on katana grab with this fix. Mm, ok. Let it be. xD\n\n## Genre:\n\n**Top-down action RPG**.\n\n\n## Description:\n\nGrab your katana and slash monsters.\n\nGet crystals to raise your speed.\n\nStruggle to have a high score.\n\nAnd relaunch the game to restart because I did not have time to add the restart feature. xD\n\n## Controls:\n\n**W,A,S,D / Arrows** - **Movement**\n\n**Aim attack with mouse**\n\n**Left Mouse Button** - **Attack**",

So here we are in the middle of nowhere, starting with nothing, but at least the alchemist thinks he's got the spell right But he's going to need his magical keys and potions...\n\n\nTo make things worse, most of his potions and magical keys have been scattered across this strange world and if he's going to have any chance of making it home he's probably going to need some of those..\n\n\n**How to play:**\n\nAlcindor can transmute earth, water and fire into either stone, fire or water.\n\nThese elements are unfortunately also the way elemental demons enter the world.\n\nSo anything (except earth) will spawn demons.\n\nLuckily the demons aren't too clever so they can be trapped or tricked.\n\n\nFire evaporates a water demon.\n\nWater extinguishes a fire demon.\n\nWater erodes a stone demon.\n\n\n\n\nCollect the keys find the portal and.\n\nAvoid the demons or trick them to their death\n\n\n**Controls:**\n\nXBox 360 controller or keyboard.\n\nButtons A/X/Y or keys E/F/G for the spells.\n\n\n**Made using:**\n\nC++ (Visual Studio 2019), SFML, Blender, Wings 3D, GIMP,LMMS, Audacity,bfxr, Notepad++.\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\nAlcindor can't really stand water, fire or demons.

      "Body": "![cover.png](///raw/c53/z/2616f.png)\nWelcome to the world of Conjury: The Convocation, the worlds hottest collectable card game. You have decided to make your place in the world by winning the prestigious masters tournament. To do so you'll have to trade cards, train your skills, outwit opponents, and play smaller tournaments to work your way up.\n\nThe game consists of three primary screens:\nCharacter - Where you can allocate points for your character, your card collection, and your deck. There are descriptions of what each skill and card type does. It's important to make your deck, it is what will be used during a match.\nHub - Where you choose what tournaments to play, trade for new cards, and access the character screen. You should try to trade after each tournament. After each tournament there is also a chance you'll get a skill point to spend.\nMatch - Playing a match against an opponent.\n\n\nHow to play a match:\nMatches are divided into four phases\n\n1. Initial Choice - During this stage you choose the Card Type you'll be focusing on and your Play Sytle. The value of each Card Type is taken from your deck. The value of each Play Style is equal to the number of points you put in that skill. Click on the cards to side to choose it, click on the ones in the center to unchoose them. You can also adjust how much you want to Cheat by using the two buttons at the bottom.\n\n2. Observation - You and your opponent now do a an opposed roll against each of your Observation skills. There are three possiblities:\n   i. You win: You get a chance to reveal either the opponents Play Style, Card Type, or their Cheating value. After you've revealed something you can make adjustments to your Play Style, Card Type, and Cheating.\n  ii. Opponent wins: You don't get to do anything. Your opponent will reveal something and make adjustments.\n iii. Tie: Both you and your opponent can make adjustments. The adjustments are applied after you reveal something.\n\n3. Resolution - You and your opponent make an opposed roll. The base number of dice rolled is the sum of the values of Play Style, Card Type, and Cheat. These are rolled against a base Target of 4. Any die rolled above or equal to the Target counts as a success. The person with the most successes win. Ties are rerolled. There are also various modifiers applied before the rolls are made.\n   i. If a players Card Type has advantage against the opponents Card Type the Target of the advantaged player's roll is reduced by one.\n  ii. If the players Play Style has advantage against the opponents Play Style the Target of the advantaged player's roll is reduced by one.\n iii. If the players Card Type and Play Style work well together the number of dice rolled is increased by one.\n  iv. If the player is using a net deck they Target of their roll is increased by one.\n\n4. Cheat Detection - Finally the winner makes an opposed roll of their Cheating stat versus how much they Cheated in the match. If the Cheated roll is greater they were caught, and they lose.\n\n\nCard Type Advantages:\nAggro beats Control\nControl beats Combo\nCombo beats Aggro\n\nPlay Style Advantages:\nBold beats Bluffing\nBluffing beats Strategy\nStrategy beats Bold\n\nType-Style Synergies:\nBold words with Aggro\nBluffing works with Control\nStrategy works with Combo",

When trading, + and - signs indicate the purchasing power of target items with respect to yours.

Choose one of four starting talents, then **beg**, work at a construction site, **sleep under the bridge**, **drug yourself**, and **become a soldier or a pilot**, but your **time is limited** -- a vast enemy force is en route to your world. A **\"narrative-driven\" RPG** with at least **four endings and even more variations** of them, an **environment that gradually changes**, and a story about facing the inevitable.\n\nMade in about 20 hours, because I believe in sleeping and had both days free for a change. It's definitely the biggest thing I've made so far, not that I've made too many of them. THERE'S ALSO A(n excuse for a) **SOUNDTRACK**! (If you can call it that...)\n\n### CONTROLS\nDescribed in-game, but still. **WSAD** to move. **E** to \"use\". **C/ESC** to open and close the Character screen, where you can mute the \"soundtrack\".\n\n### TIPS (and replay considerations)\n- **If you can't move after (re)starting a game, and you can't see the tutorial popup** (\"WASD to move, ESC/C for Character\"), **press ESC once and this should fix it.**\n- **There's no combat and the game is short.** Trust me, I wish I'd had the time to implement a twin-stick shooter on top of this so that you can be an actual pilot. Just don't get your expectations up too high. Turns out that writing a \"conversation system\" from scratch takes quite a bit more time than one would like.\n- Virtually all descriptions/interactions will change slightly depending on how far in the war you are.\n- The \"war progression\" is divided in three tiers: before the loss of the Fourth Fleet (up to day 12), before the breach of the Blockade (up to day 21), and afterwards.\n- Some endings are only available in specific \"tiers\" of the war.\n- There are two separate endings where you survive, but none where you win the war.\n- Things get either cheaper or more expensive as you progress through the tiers. Your career in the army also changes as the tiers change.\n- Some endings are only available to the \"Pliot\" and \"Marksman\" talents.\n\n### Sleep under the bridge...\n![1.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/26885.png)\n\n### ... beg on the street to make money...\n![2.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/26887.png)\n\n### ... listen to a veteran's war stories...\n![3.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/26888.png)\n\n### ... train with the ex-powerlifter security guard...\n![4.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/2688b.png)\n\n### ... buy drugs...\n![5.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/2688c.png)\n\n### ... hear the news every morning...\n![6.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/2688d.png)\n\n### ... be too weak to work at the construction site...\n![7.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/2688f.png)\n\n### ... join the military...\n![8.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/26890.png)\n\n### ... and get beaten to death while begging.\n![9.png](///raw/2e4/51/z/26892.png)",

      "Body": "NOTE: YOU ONLY GET 1 LIFE, IF YOU LOSE IT YOU MUST START OVER. ALSO THERE ARE NO CHECKPOINTS BUT ITS NOT THAT LONG OF A GAME.\n\n**BUGFIX EDIT**: I can't tell you how many times I played the game as I was designing it. But while testing it after uploading it I discovered a game breaking bug that I never encountered in all of my testing. The issue was when you got to the bottom of the red section after getting the spring the player would no longer be grounded which would cause you to be unable to jump, I checked the code and saw a potential problem and removed it. After testing it again everything seemed to be working. So I continued to play to make sure there wasn't anything else. Which of course there was because the universe is out to get me. This new issue dealt with trying to go through the red door after getting the red key. This made zero sense to me as the player has a collider and a ridgidbody and the door had a collider of it's own. If I jumped while touching the door it would open. I'm not sure what the issue was so if you encounter it, try jumping at the door. The yellow and blue doors work fine and I never encountered any error with them.\n\nTL;DR: Fixed a game breaking bug dealing with the ability to jump and found another potential one that only happens some of the time. \n\n\n**BUGFIX EDIT2**: I believe I have resolved the issue with the red door not opening after you get the red key. So run little robot run!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n ** KNOWN ISSUES **\n\n1. As mentioned above sometimes the red door will not open when you have the key. Jumping at the door is a possible way to fix it.\n\n2. Speaking of the doors, there is no sound when you open them. I meant to put one in but it kept getting pushed and as you can see it was never put in. \n\n3. Sometimes when pressing down the animation for the box is slow to start but the effect still works. Not sure why this is happening.\n\n4. Because of the way the character controller is setup it is possible to jump when falling off a platform while in the air after getting the spring that enables jumping.\n\n5. While moving forward and falling off a platform after having gotten the DUCK, if you press and hold the DOWN key to turn into a box you will continue to move forward. This is especially bad if it happens when you are going for the blue key. As you will land on the bottom platforms and be shot by the turret. Thus ending your game and snatching victory from your grasp.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nAfter suffering a vicious defeat six months ago, life with Dr Lud Umdare started getting worse and you've decided that you need to leave. After months of planning your route to the portal and the items you'll need to be successful you are ready to run.\n\nFirst you'll need a SPRING so you can jump. The way to the portal will require it. There is one in the Red section of the base.\n\nNext you'll need to get a DUCK if you're going to get by the floating sentries. The DUCK is a device Dr Lud Umdare created that allows robots to turn into boxes which the floating sentries are programmed to ignore. It just so happens to look like a duck and of no coincidence there is one in the Yellow section. \n\nLastly you'll need to get a weapon installed so you can defect the creature who guards the portal room. You have a spot for the weapon already you'll just need one last piece to complete it. That piece is stored in the Blue section. \n\nEach section will also require a door key of the same color to open them. You know each section keeps its own door key but you were not able to discover where that was.\n\nBesides the floating sentries and the portal guardian you'll also have to contend with the turrets that guard the base. The are indestructible so you'll just need to avoid their shots.\n\n\n\nOnce you get the SPRING you can start jumping using the SPACE key/Joystick Fire 1.\n\nYou use the DUCK hold the DOWN arrow key/DOWN on the joystick.\n\nTo fire the weapon once you complete it press the RIGHT CONTROL button/Joystick Fire 2.\n\n** If you miss the spring you can restart by pressing R to restart the level. **\n\n\nYou are little robot and this is your story...\n\n\n",

      "Body": "**TLDR**\n\nBuilt in tutorial uses sound, so read the tutorial here if you can't hear it for whatever reason (it is also more complete). The camera movement behaves slightly differently compared to other 3D games, will probably feel a bit weird at first. The jar is cross-platform (I hope, testing later).\n\n**TUTORIAL**\n\n**Overview**\n\nYou are a drone tasked with defending a transport ship (giant simplex sphere, can't miss it). You need to prevent incoming asteroids from hitting it, and you need to keep it powered. This tutorial is similar to the in game one, but will be a bit more complete. I am not super proud of the in game tutorial, but it is there.\n\n![screenshot.png](///raw/762/d/z/21af8.png)\n\n**Controls**\n\n**Movement**\n\nW - forward\n\nA - left\n\nS - down\n\nD - right\n\n**Abilities**\n\nRMB - fire projectile\n\nQ - match velocity\n\nE - highlight asteroids\n\n**Lose Conditions**\n\n - you can get clobbered by an asteroid.\n - the transport ship can be destroyed by asteroids if it is low enough on energy.\n - the transport ship can run out of energy.\n - your drone can run out of energy.\n - you can lose your connection with the transport ship by going too far away from it.\n\n**Ability Details**\n\n**fire projectile**\n\nif the projectile hits an asteroid, it will slowly convert the asteroids mass to energy, and then fly at you, giving you the energy. If the projectile hits the transport, the energy will just be given to the transport, this is how you power it.\n\n**match velocity**\n\nwhen activated, your autopilot calculates the impulse required to change your velocity to the object your cross hair is on and applies it, using additional energy.\n\n**highlight asteroids**\n\nthe transport ship helps you see the asteroids more clearly, highlighting all the asteroids in blue, and shows asteroids behind the transport ship.\n\n**CAMERA MOVEMENT**\n\nIn most normal 3D games, your mouse movements directly change your pitch and yaw, resulting in a camera that will only spin around when looking directly up or down. In space its harder to define an \"up\" or \"down\", and the inconsistency of the camera can make things difficult in some orientations, so I used a camera system that moves the camera relative to where you are facing at the moment. It is a bit hard to explain exactly what the differences are, but it will probably be apparent when you jump in. I remember it being a bit confusing when I first used it, but I find it more effective in space based games.\n\nI normally do, but I didn't end up adding a keyboard based roll. You can replicate that by moving your mouse in circles, try it out if you want to roll!\n\n**CROSS-PLATFORM DETAILS**\n\nMy engine should allow the jar to be cross-platform, but I don't have easy access to a Linux computer, and while I am writing this I haven't tested on mac. If your platform isn't listed, it should work for the windows jar. Let me know if it works or not so I can either update it here or fix it!\n\nTHANKS FOR PLAYING, AND HAVE FUN.",

Drag cards over enemies to play them. \n3. Press the next arrow to end your turn. \nDefense (or completely negates) incoming damage. \n\nThere are three ways to regain health: \n1. At the end of your turn you gain +1 health (this can be upgraded).\n2.  Blocking all incoming damage is likely to drop some health\n3. Killing an enemy gives you health. \n\nThere are three classes of enemies: \n1, Brutes are basic guys who on average has higher attack than other classes, \n2. Healers can heal their allies on their turn\n3. Tanks have a lot of health but generally low attack\n\nMoving the slider around increases a multiplier that increases the damage and health cost to play defensive and offensive cards. This is useful because of how the game gets harder as it goes on, but it is ultimately not a great mechanic that it would replace with a full upgrade system if I had time. \n\nOkay, I think that's all. Hope you enjoy it (at least somewhat) and sorry for the lack of music, poor art, and problematic difficultly curve. \n",

Can you find all three endings?\n\n[Hint: The ending changes based on how far into the future Timmy has travelled before giving up on the game.]\n\n--- \n## Sweet Squish\nFrom the mobile game company who brought you some of those other games you played every time you were supposed to be socially interacting comes *Sweet Squish!*\n\nFeaturing your FAVOURITE sweet treats, this crazy title puts a real spin on the classic match-3 and match-4 games you play all the time.\n\n### How do I play Sweet Squish?\nSimply click a candy to select it, then click another and they will swap places. Match 3 or 4 in a row or column to _squish_ them. Once you squish all of the candies, you have won the stage, and your score will update on our patented Global Scoreboard, for all your friends (and strangers) to see!\n\nIf you squish candies in the wrong order and you find yourself stuck, do not worry! Simply click the Quit button and try again. We won't even take your ticket away until you successfully clear the level. How nice are we?\n\n### What's a Ticket?\nEach level costs one Ticket to play. Out of tickets? No problem, you can buy more with a small amount of cash - or wait for a brief moment to earn a ticket with the passage of time.\n\n### Global Scoreboard?\nYep, the whole world can see how well (or badly) you do at Sweet Squish. If you don't want people thinking you're terrible at games, you'd better get playing!\n\n### How did you come up with this idea?\nUsing our proprietary Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ we've been able to harvest the most advanced mobile gaming technology you've ever seen. We created the *best* mobile game of the future, and brought it to the present. You're welcome.\n\n### Don't mobile games exploit people's addictions?\nHere at our company, we take these matters very seriously. That's why we promise to never do bad things with our mobile games. You have our word.\n\n### Is Sweet Squish addictive?\nOf course not. It's fun, and you'll want to keep playing it, but in the good way.\n\n### Can children play Sweet Squish?\nAbsolutely! In fact, our CEO and inventor of the Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ has just given his son a copy for his 11th birthday. If the game was addictive, that would make him a pretty irresponsible parent!\n\n\n---\n\n## How to play\n#### Sweet Squish Homescreen\nClick the \"Instructions\" button for instructions, the big \"Play\" button to play, and the red X to put away your phone.\n\n#### Dialogue\nPress [Space] when \"[Space]\" appears in the bottom-right, once the dialogue has finished displaying.\n\n#### Bedroom\nClick the Phone in the middle of the room to play Sweet Squish, click the Time Accelerator‚Ñ¢ to advance time, or the door to stop playing Sweet Squish.\n\n#### Sweet Squish\nClick a sweet to select it. Then click another sweet to swap them.\n\nThe aim is to make all sweets in a row or column the same. This will then squish them, and they will disappear. Clear the screen to win a level.\n\n\n## Known Issues on Itch version\nItch.io version won't work in Firefox 66 on Arch Linux. It seems to work in Chromium on Arch Linux with stuttery audio. \n\nSeems to work fine on Windows10 with Firefox Nightly 68.\n\nSometimes the audio plays but the screen stays black. If that happens, just refresh the page and it should work.\n\n#### Headphone users - game may be a bit loud!",

Unfortunately, robots are pretty expensive to maintain, and greatest economists of the world say that it would be more efficient to avoid maintenance costs. \n\nKeep your focus on two things: achieving level objectives and letting go the old robots that hold you back.\n\nDifficulty level only change the amount of money you get when you start the game. More money, more place for errors.\n\n### This game is difficult.\nSeriously, I didn't want to make it that hard, but it is. Some tools were created to help you:\n - In-game help: enable it on the launch screen (enabled by default, recommended).\n - In-game tooltips: if you don't understand what something means (UI or tile), there is probably a tooltip linked to it. Place your cursor over it and see a message box appear at the top of the screen.\n - In this description (\"More about game mechanics\"), you get advanced explanation about the programming mechanic (I suggest you try the game first; read this section if you don't understand how to play)\n - There is a walk-through page to help you if you get stuck in a level at http://nathanistace.be/ludumdare/44/walkthrough/\n\n### Changelog\nI provide two links to the game, the original version and a fixed version. Original version is working correctly, but fixed version gives better comfort, without changing the gameplay.\n\nAdded in the fixed version (you are not rating this):\n - Fixed a visual bug that would show the level on the menu scene\n - Lowered the default volume of some sfx\n - Cheat code: in game, type \"money\" to get +$1000 (\"But... Isn't that a way to avoid the theme?\" \"Well if you need to restart the game you lose time, you lose parts of your life, and time is money. So we could say that this cheatcode is actually more in the theme than anything else in the game!\")\n - Cheat code: in game, type lvl# where # is 0-9 to jump to another level.\n - Walkthrough page\n\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n### More about game mechanics\nIf you get stuck and can't understand how the game works, here is a more complete explaination than the one you can find in game. If you didn't start the game yet, you should start it and give it a try before reading this.\n \n![Sans titre 3.png](///raw/46b/d1/z/21d35.png)\n\nConditions work as a IF .. ELSE IF .. ELSE. Each turn, the robot will do the action corresponding to the first matched condition.\nA condition is given as IF [A] CONTAINS [B] THEN DO [C], where\n - [A] is a tile next to the robot\n - [B] is the content of the tile\n - [C] is the operation to do\n\nExample: Option 0 on this screenshot tells the robot IF [tile on right] CONTAINS [nothing] THEN DO [move to the right]\n\nThe OTHERWISE case only contains the [C] part, that will be executed if no other option condition is matched.\n\nContent conditions: \n - The star matches anything on the tile: steel blocks, wooden boxes, flags, spawn platforms \u0026 robots\n - The full square matches fixed or pushable items: steel blocks, wooden boxes \u0026 robots\n - The robot matches robots\n - The empty square matches empty tiles\n \nOperarations:\n - The left arrow tells to move left\n - The right arrow tells to move right\n - The star tells to do the robot's special action\n - The Zzz's tells to do nothing\n",

But the AI was too hard to make in 48 hours)\n\nHOW TO PLAY?\nSimple. Everything runs on energy. Once the energy is depleted the shield of that unit collapses and the unit is destroyed. At the begining of your turn all units get some of their energy back thanks to their generator. Also every action such as move, attack, build takes some energy to do(cause the theme is \"Life is currency\"). It's only on you how much energy you leave in the unit's shield. It will stay that way until the start of your next turn.\nWhen you are done hit END TURN to start turn of your enemy.\nIf something doesn't want to work, right click somewhere into the battlefield. It will cancel everything and hopefully be fine.\n\nAll the numbers important to the units are visible in some parts of the game I will also include a .txt file on my website with all of them PLEASE GIVE FEEDBACK. I didn't have time for much play-testing so something might be OP(it probably is). I don't know if that counts as \"minor bug fixes\" so I can add it into the jam version but I would like my game to be balanced at least in later versions.\n\nHere are some screenshots:\n![LD44 screen 2.png](///raw/3a3/22/z/2193c.png)\n![LD44 screen 3.png](///raw/3a3/22/z/2193d.png)\n![LD44 screen 4.png](///raw/3a3/22/z/2193e.png)",

Click on the ones you want to sell, you can see where organisms will die and new ones appear depending on your selections.\nThe aim of the game is to make as much GLC (Gross Life Currency) as possible.\nOh and theres carnivorous entities as well, maybe they can be useful in your scheme - but most likely not.\n\n![Lifestock_small.png](///raw/2b2/22/z/21840.png)\n\nI didn't have time to add instructions or a tutorial, so here is an overview:\n\nGreen circles represent living organisms. Organisms will die and spawn according to the following rules:\nAn empty (red) circle will spawn a new organism if it has exactly 3 living (green) neighbours.\nA living (green) circle will survive to the next round if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours.\nIn all other cases living circles will die and turn red.\n\nThe game is divided into 3 day cycles and 3 night cycles. During the day cycles the simulation will run on it's own. During the night cycles the player can sell any organisms. Select a green circle to see what the effect will be if you sell it.\nThe aim of the game is to keep the colony alive for as long as possible, and also to sell of as many organisms as possible. The final score will be the amount of organisms you have sold.\n\nThe predators may intervene in your plans in unexpected ways, but add to your total earnings. (Also they are kind of buggy and unfinished) ;)\n\nThe game is based on a mathematical simulation / algorithm called Game of Life:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Life",

How much of his life will it cost them ?\n\nA game about choices, boxes, giving away its life at work to buy fancy stuff at home, jumping, using its arms, but mostly doing very annoying tasks with a box in the middle of your FoV that you can merely look around because you have a torticollis ... and broken physics, ofc.\nLift the box, bring it to the green tile, looks simple uh ?\n\n![gifExploited.gif](///raw/136/22/z/24565.gif)\n\n\nSadly I lost a lot of time learning of new stuff like mainly on Unity and 3D like its physics, materials, UIs, etc That was more than expected so I couldn't make a soundtrack. First solo game jam is hard, and I think you've heard and seen that playing my game x) But hey, you can do a lot things in that game ! \n\nHere are a reminder of the controls (also shown at the first level) if it can help you :\n![1stScreen.png](///raw/136/22/z/218c1.png)\n\nI've mainly used Unity 3D 2018 3.1.6f; Photoshop, Paint.net, Magicavoxel and Visual Studio.\n\nPlease tell me what you've liked or not about my game, how you felt about it, looking to share and improve :) And tell me which endings you got, or the interesting ways you found of solving the levels (I've found very nice and surprising ones already) !\n\nI hope you enjoyed it, and got a satisfying ending (or all of them, better x) ) !\n\nEdit 2 : with the latest build I'm only missing nice soundtracks (and good physics but hey I'm only starting Unity 3D), which I'll never create. \nWhen evaluating my game please consider the build you're playing and how much time I've taken out of the game jam to make it, for fairness concerns :)\n\nEdit 3 : You can now watch my full walkthrough video, which I edited only for the different endings (which is full of spoilers, so I suggest you try the game before). So this is a honest gameplay video which highlights how much Frederique can glitch and how anoying it can be x) Here : \n\nhttps://youtu.be/sAXeLggCdG4\n\nEdit 4 : Version 4 out ! This one should be way more enjoyable than the others and took me only 10 mins to make. That's the one I should have submitted for the jam but hey thought about it too late. Translation movement is so easier than adding force to the character uh.\n\nChangelog :\n\n- Character movement is now a translation and not an acceleration\n\n- No more glitchy anoying rotations\n\n- Fixed the factory walls",

My artistic and musical skills are a bit lacking, but I hope you all can enjoy the game I produced anyways! \n\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/27e/11/z/20ff4.png)\n\nRules:\n0. The goal of the game is to sell Lemonade (and later, hotdogs and icecreams)\n1. Play cards by dragging them onto the brown area (\"the stand\")\n2. You pay for playing cards with health (red) and energy (green)\n3. If you don't have customers you can't play cards that require customers.\n4. Each turn you will recover 2 energy and draw a new hand of 3 cards. \n5. The day ends if you end your turn with 0 customers\n6. After the day ends you get to add 2 cards to your deck by paying a certain amount of health\n7. Try to keep a high score each day to keep your customers happy! :)\n\nBesides that, a couple things to keep in mind:\n1. Customers will start leaving faster each day\n2. Red circles mean a health cost, green circles are the energy cost\n3. Lemonades grant 1 base score, hotdogs 2 and icecreams 3\n4. It's not extremely balanced. I decided it would be better to make the game a bit more rounded instead\n5. If the itch.io version glitches due to size, then I recommend trying the stand-alone build in 1024 x 768\n\nIf you have any questions or are missing something, please let me know :)\n\n![Capture2.PNG](///raw/27e/11/z/20ff5.png)",

This year, I had a bit more knowledge to draw on.  Ended up throwing far too much at the wall and seeing what would stick - most of the stuff developed for this hasn't made it into the final build (the code is still in there though, if you're curious).  As before, learnt a whole lot though; and very pleased with how quickly I've been able to prototype ideas this time 'round (even if they didn't make it in).  Less pleased with the actual game.  The big lesson from this year?  Time management - specifically, how not to.\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoy.  Not the best interpretation of the theme, gotta say.  Game itself is sorta cosy, though; maybe put the FTL soundtrack on while playing for some ambiance.\n\n**Software:** Unity, Visual Studio, Affinity Designer, Famitracker, Audacity.",

I had fun trying to learn how to animate explosions though!\n\n![LD44_2019-04-29_21-23-35.png](///raw/bf7/d1/z/21d9d.png)\n\n## Random notes:\n* There's no ending. At least 1 boss was planned, but only the main gameplay loop exists and it continues indefinitely. \n* I've implemented stages of 4 levels each. This doesn't yet affect the gameplay (besides random \"maps\" after stage 0)\n* Ideally I wanted 1 miniboss/hard level per stage and the boss on the 4th+. Of course, each stage with changing background visuals too (..making 1 was difficult enough though).\n* The 'Health/currency' system was supposed to be more robust, involving hp-\u003escrap-\u003eupgrades, inventory, modules and on-the-fly repairs. It ended up being a lame direct hp cost.\n* The shop is particularly hacked and rushed.\n* Obviously not as balanced as it could be.\n* No sound at all. I had some cool ideas but alas, time.\n* I don't know why I went for this specific design of 'tank'. I think my brain had an image of a huge tracked vehicle chugging through the desert. Somehow that translated into WWI tanks.\n* The whole idea kind of flopped. The core mechanics are... what even are they? I need to work on my game design! \n* Despite this, there's something about this I feel very fond about but I can't seem to put my finger on it. Might be worth revisiting.\n* I was going for something kind of like the Android game 'Minute Quest'.\n* 30 minutes later: Yeah I was going for a roguelite (you can tell by the existence of a pre-game intro), but decided to hack it into a 'grinding game' after seeing the clock. Still missing some features for that though.\n",

      "Body": "The Robo-Lizards have taken over Crankville! Smashing shops, building huts, everything being in chaos.\nMeanwhile, young adult Bileous isn't worrying about the Robo-Lizards. He's just living a life in exalted solitude, trying to be outside as little as possible, as if he's outside, then he's more likely to get a scar or two than get a small sunburn in summer. You see, Bileous is a social outcast. He messed up a VERY important meeting on accident, and that lowered his social currency into the negative thousands. So, there goes any chance AT ALL to be said \"Hi\" to or to be given anything more than dirt on his birthday.\n\nBut then, the Robo-Lizards put everyone in jail, except Bileous! (he's very protected from everything - even dust particles are eliminated from his house!!!) And then, Bileous knew how to win everybody's hearts. How to bring his social currency to the positives. He would have to... defeat the Robo-Lizards!!!\n\nUnfortunately for Bileous, he couldn't by any protection because 1. everybody was imprisoned and 2. even if the armorer wasn't imprisoned, he couldn't buy anything from anybody in Crankville. So, he had to risk his life to do this - therefore, his life (whether he lived or not) was his social currency.\n\nTo blow up the control/production center for the robots, Bileous has to get five things: a key, a switch, a hijacker, a computer, and a wrench. They are scattered all around a map covered with Robo-Lizards - which are kind of hard to evade. But it will be worth it... if you can actually survive. Good luck, Bileous! :) Also, Robo-Huts spawn infinite numbers of Robo-Lizards. Fortunately for Bileous, if there are too many Robo-Lizards at once, then the system crashes and therefore some of the Robo-Lizards have to self-destruct to stabilize the system.",

You guest is they only let you pay with blood, but you eating Blood Flower gives you blood back.\n\nThe ground in this area is very bad, so you have to fertilize the ground before you can plant, once a plot has been fertilized in can support a few plants before you have to do it again.\n\nWhen a flower is fully grown it will pop off the ground, Blood Flowers are very delicate, so pick the up quickly before they vanish\n\nYou will get attacked by monsters, when a monster hits you you lose blood. Be careful so you don‚Äôt bleed out. You can see your blood and seed count in the top left corner.\n\nThe vampire shop don‚Äôt only sell seeds, it also has a few upgrades and if you get enough blood you can buy your freedom.\n\nKeep in mind, your body can only have so much blood inside it, luckily the vampire shop is also your local blood bank, so deposit some blood if you are near your max.

Each potion would transform a person, critter, or animal into some other critter, animal, or a different looking person. The idea being that in some ways we should view our own lives as a currency only so much as that we only have so long to live. Wouldn't it be best to live it most happily, as we most want to be seen and as who we are?\n\nI really dislike the idea of selling or trading your life for commodities or even survival/living, so I didn't want to do anything with that concept.

It shows key landmarks in the galaxy. Search near the landmarks for characters who want something from Bartleby. If its not in his inventory, they'll also tell him where to find it. Follow the chain of requests to get the items Bartleby needs to fix his ship!\n\nBartleby has ten minutes of oxygen in his tank.

Looks like there is no turning back now.\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- Godot Engine\n- Krita\n- sfxr\n- Studio One\n\n## Fonts\n\n- Silkscreen: http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/index.html\n- SH PINSCHER: https://www.behance.net/gallery/49541299/SH-Pinscher-Free-Bitmap-Font\n",

Every stage is generating at the runtime.\nI am not sure about the game balance but maybe later i can work on it for a post jam version.\n\n**HOW TO PLAY**\n\nYou should pass all stages step by step.You can use WASD to MOVE and R to interact with the game. There is no any save mechanism so you have to be carefull while you are dealing with the enemies. You have a soul value. Actually soul value is representing your hit point and also your souls is your currency so you can buy upgrades with them but you have to be carefull.\n\n**CONTROLS**: WASD to MOVE | R for actions\n\n**TOOLS I USED**\n\nHTML5/Javascript with Phaser V2\n\nAseprite \u0026 Photoshop\n\nRytmik Studio \n\nSFXR\n\n[twitter.com/obsfx](https://twitter.com/obsfx)\n\n[Play On Browser](https://obsfx.github.io/ld44-danger-in-the-snow/)\n\n",

Run faster, jump farther, teleport through walls -- if you don't succumb to radiation poisoning first.\n\n![hs.png](///raw/8d0/41/z/2450c.png)\n\nThe game includes a crappy built-in tutorial, but here are some directions:\n* Left/right arrow to move, Z to jump, X to use special abilities.\n* Hold Shift to see names and descriptions of all of your genes.\n* The more uranium you carry, the more genes you have, and the higher up you go, the faster you'll lose genes.\n* Time is paused when you're in a checkpoint/shop area. Use them to take a breather.\n* There are 12 different genes to find. Catch 'em all!\n\nThis was an exciting one, despite the theme! The more I stared at it, the more I became convinced that it's basically a subset of the last theme. I ended up looking to the other final-round themes for inspiration, but still found a way to incorporate \"your life is currency\"... at least I think I did. I suppose you'll be the judge. I was determined to make a more actiony game since my last three have been word-based, but it meant straying way outside my artistic comfort zone. The art took a ton of time. I don't even remember writing the music. The code was no walk in the park either... it really came down to the wire! I went 30+ hours without sleep at the end, and it was worth it. I learned new stuff and made a genre of game I've never made before.\n\nDone in Unity/C#. Also used Photoshop, Illustrator, FL Studio, and Audacity. Font is Umba Soft by Anita J√ºrgeleit.\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES**\n* It's definitely possible to become unable to progress due to lack of genes or misaligned map chunks. I can try to fix it if you post a screenshot.\n* The balance is pretty poor, in general. If you play enough of it to get a sense of the pacing, let me know of any changes you think should be made.\n* There's not that much level variety. Feel free to fork it on Github and add some!\n* I haven't tested the Mac or Linux builds at all. I'm sure there will be problems...",

Anyways, I hope you like my game, I'm  going to go pass out now.\n\n(Xbox one controllers are supported, not sure about other controllers)\n\nA video about the creation of this game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtDzQz4zx4g",

The source code is available at the links below. \n\nThis was my very first game jam, so I didn't really know what to expect and how I should do things. In the end, I am quite happy with the result, even though I would have liked to polish the game some more. Especially the UI elements, which I made during the last ~1 hour, could use some (a lot of) polishing. \n\nAlso, some more balancing time could have been nice. The game is on the difficult side. Also, getting the exploding bullets is a bit to hard to actually be useful.\n\n### Post-deadline changes:\n\n- Very small UI bugfix\n- This description text\n- Added some missing DLLs",

Keep Sir Whale and Fatstacks the Hunter alive by [Tab] targeting them and using your 4 abilities.  You allies are wealthy casual adventurers and will pay you in gold for each point of health you restore! When you've amassed enough gold, you can [5] send 1000 gold donations back to your church to receive upgrades to your abilities.  If you collect all the upgrades, you win!\n\n# **Controls:**\n\n[A],[D] or [\u003c-], [-\u003e] - Move left/right\n\n[Tab] - Change healing target\n\n# **Abilities:**\n\n[1] - _**Heal Other:**_ After a 1.75 second cast time, heal your ally for 17% of your ally's maximum health.  This ability has a cooldown of 3 seconds.\n\n[2] - _**Charged Heal:**_ Press and hold [2] to build up a powerful healing effect for up to 8 seconds. When released, heal your currently targeted ally for a percentage of their maximum health equal to the percentage of the time spent charging this ability.  This ability has a cooldown of 10 seconds.\n\n[3] - _**Regenerative Leash:**_ After a 1 second cast time, apply a heal over time effect to your targeted ally.  Heals 4% of the ally's maximum health per second for 10 seconds.  This effect will end early if the recipient strays too far from the cleric.  This ability has a cooldown of 20 seconds.\n\n[4] - _**Turn Undead:**_ After a 2 second cast time, destroys all skeletons attacking your party.  Your allies rely on you to kill skeletons, because they are too frightened to fight back.  This ability has a 35 second cooldown.\n\n[5] - _**Donate to the Church:**_ After a 5 second cast time, you use your divine powers to send a gold donation back to your church. Donate 1000 gold per cast to receive the posted ability upgrade in the top right corner of the screen from the church as a blessing.

Manage your happiness, money and vitality and reach your dreams!\n\n# How to play?\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134154440.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417e.png)\n\n## Goal\n\nYou are a boy that wanna be game developer. Your goal could be reach your dreams, become rich, being happy or get older (or maybe a mix of all of them, it is possible!!!). Also, you can play to discover several ways to die :P.\n\nGame ends when you spend all your life and die (it could take about 2-3 minutes if you get that far in the game). Then the game will show you a summary of your life.\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134111868.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417d.png)\n\n## Game flow\n\nEvery month you can make an action. **All actions take a cost of life**, and will change your life state. You have 3 game indicators that will give you all the information that you need for knowing the progress in your life.\n\n### Life\n\nIt's the most basic parameter. **When life is over you die**.\n\n### Happiness\n\nMost of the actions you make affects to your happiness. If this bar is over your life cost of your actions will be increased dramatically. **Be sure you take a break every now and then ;)**.\n\n### Money\n\nGet fun costs money. Get independent cost soo much money. **Living is not free!** If your money is negative you will start to lose your Happiness.\n\n## Actions\n\nActions (or decisions) are divided in 3 sections that you can navigate clicking the gray buttons. If you put the cursor over an action, a panel in the right will show you the immediate consequencies of that action.\n\n### Fun\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134315087.png](///raw/e4e/z/2417f.png)\n\nIt will improve your happiness. At the beginning your only action is \"Play\", but you will get more ways to get fun in the future!\n\n### Study\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501134214995.png](///raw/e4e/z/24181.png)\n\nLearning is essential to get a job. As in real life, the most of the early years you will have to learn the basic stuff (General learnings). After that you could start to study about your vocation: videogames.\n\n### Work\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501132818326.png](///raw/e4e/z/24182.png)\n\nWhen you have basic learnings you can have a crap job and earn some money. If you abandon your dreams, you can get experience and apply to better jobs. Maybe it could be easier being happy and rich! Else, **your first jobs in the videogames industry will be unpaid**. You must work as internship or make free jobs before you can become a game developer. Nobody said reaching your dreams was easy!\n\n**NOTE:** There are a lot of jobs that you could unlock studying and working. For example, if you get experience as programmer and artist, you could work as technical artist. Even, if you work hard, **you will be able to found your own big videogames company!!!**\n\n### Special action: become independent\n\n![GameDevLife.960x600.20190501135258668.png](///raw/e4e/z/24184.png)\n\nWhen you are 18 years old you feel that you need your space. **If you get independent, you will spend $1,000 per month, but if you stay at your parents home you will be less happy every month**. Become independent as soon as you have a paid job!",

Placing player not into direct control of the game, but with key influence (and responsibility, in this case, for cargo delivery).\n\n### About the game\nThis game is intentionally missing any action mechanics. It is more like bringing you as a player to relaxing meditative environment. Observe and navigate the sailboat by telling your helmsmate. There is no other goal to reach than the sailing while avoiding obstacles itself.\n\n![cover.png](///raw/b56/31/z/21d83.png)\n\n### Post submission\nPreferable version to play with few little tweaks done after 48h limit.

All you arrive with is a map, a small bottle, and 100 pounds (camouflaged as dollars in-game), and you must locate the treasure, hidden miles away, deep into the desert. Your money is only useful for buying some equipment in the starting town; from then on, you must trade your precious water away; your lifeline. Equipment ranges from water-carrying items, helping you survive longer in the desert (and trade for more things), to navigation equipment, which is crucial for not getting lost in the desert.\n\nI've also implemented what I consider to be a rather interesting mechanic: the ability to toward the horizon. This allows you to navigate by the sun and the stars, as well as letting you know when you're nearby to a village, if you're ever lost (which you will be if you don't buy navigation equipment (and aren't a pro navigator)).\n\nI would like to apologize in advance to any astronomers; I have simplified the cosmos quite a bit, due to time, but what you need is all there.\n\nThere is music!

If you use all the powerups and actions you can easily beat it without getting damage.  \n\n![ld44_002.png](///raw/e40/3/z/21690.png)  \n![ld44_003.png](///raw/e40/3/z/21691.png)  \n![ld44_004.png](///raw/e40/3/z/21693.png)  \n\nMade with pico 8 and the super fast framework.\n\n## Some tips (Don't read them if you want to figure it out yourself!):\n~~When destroying a spawner you get a health pack that restores some health for the player and the ghost.~~  \n~~Since each bomb blast costs 1/4 of the ghost's health, you have 3 to use consecutively coming from a full life bar in ghost. If you combine this knowledge with the step 1 you can risk going for a spawner without getting hits on hero or ghost and then with the health pack regain a new bomb blast for future use.~~  \n~~At this point you should have gotten all the powerups and be killing everything in your way.~~  ",

I have also added a skip tutorial button so you don't have to run it each and every time you start the game. The sacrifice button won't work if there are anymore than 2 cubes in the sacrifice area. \n\nThis is my first ever ludum dare. I definitley overscoped and didn't touch on hardly anything I originally planned. Happy to get out a working game though.\n\nThe game will take ages if you don't sacrifice your evolved cubes/animals. The more evolved they are the more they are worth! Some colours are also worth much more than others.\n\nYou can select a cube by left clicking or clicking and draging to select more than one. You can also hold shift while clicking to select more than 1 cube at a time. To move a cube/cubes while selected click the right mouse button. \n\nStarting off with simple blue cubes, can you evolve it into 8 different species?\n![MainScreen.png](///raw/61f/c1/z/1cc4f.png)\n\nNOTE (Change Log): I have fixed the bug where 2 cubes being squished before the tutorial says so bugs out the game. The altar will not work in the initial press unless only 1 cube is on it. Also a minor fix with some of the cubes not evolving to the correct coloured animal.\n\nThere has been quite a few bugs with my horribly created tutorial! haha I will definitely be testing a lot more then next time I do something similar! I have added a check button at the top left of the screen just in case the tutorial bugs out. That way you can still at least continue the game.\n\nI have rescaled the points system. Big thanks to @evogengames for pointing out if you added all the cost to evolve there really wasn't much benefit to sacrificing the more evolved animals. It's much more of a benefit now to squish those beautiful creatures :smile: \n\nThanks for heads up :smile: I have updated the sourcecode as well so the change can be seen in Bitbucket.\n\n**SPOILER (how to get all the different colours):**\n- The easiest way to get all the colours is to mix every colour with blue.\n- 2 blues make yellow.\n- 1 blue 1 yellow make green.\n- 1 blue 1 green makes purple.\n- etc.\n\nThere are many other different ways to make all the colours as well if you prefer to try and figure them out :smile: \n",

Your god demands sacrifices in his honor, and promises to bestow you with ever-increasing power the more you sacrifice. But beware, such a promise has been given to all who suffer in this realm. Will you rise above the rest, or will you be destroyed by them? One way or the other, there is no salvation.\n\n### Controls\n* WASD or Arrow Keys to move\n* Click to attack in the direction you're moving\n* Space opens and closes the upgrade menu\n* Shift and Ctrl also work in Spectator Mode\n\n### Description\nBasically, the game is a never-ending team deathmatch. The stakes are constantly escalating, as new people are being poured into the world. Each carries a soul, and the killer of each gets all those souls (even the used ones), meaning the amount of souls ever only goes up. The AI also knows how to purchase upgrades for themselves, so there's a possibility you will eventually face someone much exceeding your own level of strength.  \nThe game is played on a 1km¬≤ map, and there are also some unarmed characters serving as easy pray.\n\n### Spectator Mode\nIf you get tired of that, you can go enjoy Spectator Mode, which is the same game, but you can fly around and see how everyone is squabbling. It's a lot of fun, and if you leave it running for long enough, you might just see some characters emerging as superior fighters, and thus the populations of those gods increasing.",

I enjoyed making this game, it challenged me and I got to play around with stuff I don't usually explore in a LD. It was hard finding an aesthetic that worked well with the gameplay and concept, so I just went simple. Unfortunately due to the nature of the controls, (which should be explained in game but there is an attached cheatsheat), it is gamepad only. I might make a future mouse and keyboard one if I have time. The game is a bit shorter than I would have liked, and sparse in terms of audio, but that just comes down to time.\n\n![2018-12-02 (1).png](///raw/2a1/z/1b90b.png)\n\nHave fun!",

Disaster strikes when a transport ship heading for you with vital resources, crash lands and damages the colony! You must keep the colony alive until help arrives at any cost. Some may even have to make the ultimate sacrifice for the survival of the colony.\n\n# Controls\n- Point and click with the mouse\n- Scroll around the map with WASD, arrow keys or by touching the edges of the screen with the cursor\n- Hold down the Shift key to scroll faster\n\n![Skjermbilde 2018-12-03 kl. 04.21.50.png](///raw/7ff/7/z/1c9a8.png)\n\n# How to play\nThe various locations on the map will deteriorate and break down quickly. When a problem arrises in a location, a number is displayed over the location. Click the location to see the problems that need fixing.\n\nEach problem has a specific type (biology, electronics, engineering) and a risk rating. If you click on a task you may then select whom to send to the task. Different people are good at different things, so select the people that are skilled in the type of problem you wan't to fix.\n\nThe more skilled the people are, and the more people you select, the lower the risk rating will be. Safety in numbers! The risk rating determines the chance of the crew taking damage and how much damage they take.\n\nOnce the task has been completed the assigned people receive damage, get more experienced in the type of problem they just fixed and are now available to take on new tasks!\n\nNote: People heal as long as they are home on the base and not assigned to any task.\n\nKeep on trying to fix problems as they pop up and try to save the colony!\n\n![Skjermbilde 2018-12-03 kl. 04.20.48.png](///raw/7ff/7/z/1c9a1.png)",

It costs 1 key to open a door.\n\n* Potions just occupies space, and are good candidates to sacrifice first.\n\n* There is also a limit of 10 items in your Inventory. Any more and the first one will be removed.\n\n* Killing a monster will also sacrifice your item in your first slot.\n\n(Sorry about forgetting to write these things, it's my first compo and writing instructions is hard.)\n\n![cover image here](///content/7e/z/1c691.png)\n\n=============\n\n### Short Story\n\nYou, the player, has somehow find yourself in the middle of a dungeon full of monsters and items.\n\nYour goal is to leave the Dungeon alive through the stairs somewhere near the opposite corner.\n\n\n### Keys and instructions\n\nYour character :levitate: starts somewhere in the top left, and the exit is somewhere at the bottom right side of the dungeon. :door:\n\nUse the cursor keys to move around, if you try to go to a place with a monster then you'll have a fight.\n\nThe keys X and C can be used to cycle through your inventory; this is important because the first item in your inventory will be lost after a fight with a monster!\n\n\n### My first Compo game\n\nThis is my first Compo game, and I've done Ludum Dare for some time now. I have never managed to finish within 48 hours but somehow this time I managed to do it! :smile:\n\nI thought Jam was hard, but here I have even less time to add anything that's not crucial to the game!\n\nNo time for levels, sounds, special effects, more graphics, animations, or even instructions (I'm not very good at those, so it will only costs even more time...)\n\nMy goal here was to just make something that is challenging even if it's randomly generated, simple looking but still challenging every time I play.

Manipulate the bridges over the Rio Trio Bridgeo river to keep as many drivers alive as possible, without letting Police/Firefighters perish! \n\nThe fate of the mundane motorists is in your hands. Sure, you want to save them all, but you will need to sacrifice a few (or a lot) to save America's finest. \n\n## How To Play\n\n* Click and drag the bridges to move them in position to save careless drivers.\n\n* Click a vehicle once to slam on its brakes. Click it again to get it going again.\n\n* Don't let the Police/Firefighters die! If 5 of them die, you're done! You will have to give up on some civilians to save all the emergency vehicles. Live and let die!\n\n## About Me:\n\nThis was my fifth Ludum Dare game and the first time I've ever finished a game with primarily 3D assets. I really struggled making even rudimentary low-poly meshes and especially texturing them. My hat's off to all the real 3D artists out there. I also really struggled with the theme this time. I didn't decide on my idea until about 15 hours into the Compo, and I'm still not sure the sacrifice thing really came through. I wanted to make the player feel like he was sacrificing the civilians, sometimes several, to keep one emergency vehicle alive. Time will tell if that comes across.    \n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity\n* Blender\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n\n",

If pride gets to high then a sacrifice must be made. This game is suppose to represent two people having an argument about to break up. This is my first LD :D i had a blast. Thank you so much for playing! All feedback positive or negative will help me grow as a designer so please feel free to leave a comment down below.\n\n\nHOW TO PLAY: ( Not being able to add in a tutorial i decided to write one this is kinda spoiler but at least you will know what is going on ) :D\n------------------------\nThe blocks are falling under gravity so you'll need to click where they will be not where they are just by a little if you practice you will pick up on this fast. The goal of this game is not to win the argument but its to get both people on the same page, as in a real argument its rarely the exact contents of the problem we are fighting over but rather we are just fighting each other. This is represented by color text boxes so match blue with a falling blue block and that person will gain some love, if you manage to get both peoples asking for the same color they will continue to ask for the same color until your timer at the bottom fills up or you miss click( you get a free mess up too ). Every time you sync up your timer bar will reset. \n\nPride is the yellow bar this fills up slowly over time and is the round end trigger. When one persons pride maxes out they will loose half of their current love, and  you will get to chose to hurt them or hurt the other person. The person you choose to hurt will get a heart strike. Heart strikes decrease the time it takes that persons pride bar to fill up. After receiving your 4th heart strike on one person they will leave pack all there bags and never come back. They did after all take quite the beating. Love can be messy.\n\nLove is the pink bar that grows each time you make a match. When both players reach max love you win and they learned to fight the problem not each other. Remember love is about sticking it out and helping each other grow in the darkest of times pride is leaving... if you want a happy relationship check your ego/pride at the door :D and compromise that person sitting next to you may not always be there tomorrow. So at the end of the day love each other and fight the battles together you can do it I believe in you!\n\n( WARNING: I'm just a human that makes games on the internet not a love dr. \u003c3 ) ",

At the start my idea was that you were a slime that would have to squeeze through passages smaller than yourself by shedding slime, or sacrificing it. Eventually that turned into putting your slime into pits to get across.\n\nI know that this game is not fool proof, but it's short enough that exiting and restarting will not give you too much of a setback.\n\nMy favorite part of this jam would have been figuring out how to select a custom color via player input. I was probably a lot happier than I should have been, but I was determined to get my cyan slime and it was a satisfying conclusion!\n\nMy biggest regret is how much I slept, as I think I could have finished a lot more if I shaved 4-5 hours off my slumber. Though it may be the other way around if I did take the cut haha.\n\nI look forward to checking out what everyone else has created!\n\n\nSide note:\nI had some troubles uploading to GitHub. I believe everything is there, but if anything is missing, I can see if I can get it uploaded, or I can dropbox the project if necessary. \n\nKnown bug: if a single horizontal direction is held going through a door, occasionally the player will become unaligned with the regular path.

Your party must hazard over 4 thousand miles to Jeuno Alaska, where there's whispers of a safe zone.\n\n![ss-3.png](///raw/86a/3/z/1bdf3.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay:\nAssign your party members tasks to undertake at night.

Use the right party member for the task.\n\n\n## Tools Used:\n* Unity\n* Gimp\n* bfxr\n* http://www.fakemusicgenerator.com/ \n* Audacity\n\n## Screenshots:\n![ss-1.png](///raw/86a/3/z/1bdee.png)\n\n![ss-2.png](///raw/86a/3/z/1bdf0.png)\n\n\n\n",

You decide.\n\n\n\n## **The Development**\n\nThis was my first participation in the Ludum Dare. It was a fun and challenging experience.\n\nAll elements of the game were created at 48Hrs.\n\nI think I spent too much time creating mechanics and I ended up running out of time to balance and create more levels.\n\nI have received several excellent feedbacks. I will make a new version with more levels and more balanced.\n\n\n![img2.PNG](///raw/123/e1/z/1c6b7.png)\n\n\n\n## **The Control**\n\nRMB - Aim to move the atom\n\nLMB - Shoot in the direction of the cursor\n\nZ - Dash\n\n\n\n## **The Tools**\n\nUnity - Development\n\nPiskel - Textures\n\nChrome Music Lab - Music\n\nSfxr - SFX\n\n\n\n## **The Thanks**\n\nFor Ludum Dare team and you for playing this game =]\n\n![img4.png](///raw/123/e1/z/1c6ba.png)\n\n\n\n## **Update**\nThank you all for the feedback, I really enjoyed it.\n \nI considered several and updated the game. \n\nNow with a better level design and adjustment in the controls. \n\nPlease consider play again the post jam version.\n\nhttps://kaish.itch.io/atomic-lifetime-postld\n",

Can you avoid the lava and burning rocks that stand in your way?  Find out in Volcano Rush!\n\n**Controls:**\n\n**[A]** Moves Backward\n**[D]** Moves Forward\n**[Space]** Jumps.\n\n**Tools Used:**\n\nVisual Studio, Notepad++, ZBrush, Blender, Photoshop, Audacity, FontBuilder, FL Studio.\n\nThis was created using my [custom C++ game library](https://github.com/jharler/ZeroTolerance). All bugs are totally my fault.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nI hope you have fun and if you could, please leave me some feedback, even if it‚Äôs just ‚Äúhey, this sucks‚Äù or ‚Äúhey, that was fun.‚Äù\n\n**Notes**\n\nBe aware that jumping might feel a bit odd.  The way I implemented following the path around the mountain makes for some interesting jumps in some spots.  It shouldn't take long to get used to and you might not even notice it at all.  The hitboxes on the lava are a bit generous, so you can get pretty close before jumping.  Keep that in mind if you are having trouble making it over the lava.\n\n**Known Bugs**\n\nThere is a bug that prevents the game from loading on some computers.  I've fixed at least one cause of this, which is v2 in the Itch downloads.  If you get a message in the original version that says \"An exception has occurred\", please try v2.\n\nThere is also a bug that leaves black pixels on the screen.  This seems to be on non-Nvidia cards.  I uploaded v3 which should fix this issue.\n\n**Playthrough**\n\nBelow is a video playthrough of the game.  I highly recommend playing the game to experience it first hand, but this is here if you want it.\n\n[Playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czus8BG2Lz8)\n",

He's thrown you all into his dungeon and is using you as lab rats to test out his vicious creations in combat. All the exits are blocked by nuclear ultra laser barriers powered by magnets. If anyone touches it, they die! But wait... even though the barrier is deadly, it breaks after killing certain people.\n\nFigure out the pattern, and sacrifice your fellow lab-rats so that others may escape! Also see if you can reach all of the 9 exits! (so that I know if it's possible or not :P)\n\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThis is a dungeon crawler that is focused on resource management. Your primary resource is people; they're the keys to unlocking the various barriers in the dungeon. When a red person touches a red barrier, both that person and the barrier explode. So your goal is to try to escape by sacrificing the right amount of people.\n\nIf you push a red person into a blue barrier, the barrier changes into blue. So if you don't have the required color to open a barrier, you could still get past it by sacrificing two of another color.\n\nThe dungeon is HUGE (all things considered) and there are NINE alternate exits, each with unique sets of challenges.\n\n## NO BACKTRACKING!!\n\nResist the temptation to backtrack. Every single door will take you to an exit, but if you go backwards you‚Äôll risk wasting your people by opening more doors than you have to. When you see a fork in the road, pick a door and stick with it! The main difference between each choice is the difficulty. The rooms and monsters are NOT randomly generated, but your supply of people IS. If you get a poor color distribution, you can still probably win through any path if you‚Äôre careful not to lose anyone during the enemy and boss fights.\n\n# Instructions\n\nThere are 3 types of BARRIERS\n\n* Color Barriers: sacrifice a person with the matching color to destroy this barrier\n\n* Mob Barriers: kill the specified number of enemies to destroy this barrier (touching the barrier doesn't kill you)\n\n* Boss Barriers: kill the specified number/type of bosses to destroy this barrier (touching the barrier doesn't kill you)\n\nThere are also 3 COLORS. Colors affect the damage you do in combat. The color of your attack is the color of your current team leader. The color of an enemy's healthbar tells you what color it is. Hitting a color with itself does half damage (so red on red has a 0.5 multiplier). Here are the damage bonus match-ups:\n\n* Red: Double damage against green\n\n* Green: Double damage against blue\n\n* Blue: Double damage against red\n\n\n# CONTROLS\n\nWASD - MOVE\n\nLMB - SHOOT\n\nJ/L - Cycle between team leaders\n\nK - Split up team (the purple arrow is the 'splice' point)\n\nSHIFT + LMB - Click a separated team to make it active\n\nTAB - Cycle between teams\n\n\n# Bugs\n\n * It seems like the pink ball boss will grow to enormous proportions if you shoot him too fast. Although, that kinda works out because one of its rooms is glitched and doesn‚Äôt let you shoot. If you get into that situation, you could just shoot him so he grows so large that you can hit him from another room!\n\n * The headphone monster will give you way too many coins when you kill it. So if you run into another one, you can just skip the fight and go straight to the barrier\n\n\n * Pathfinding is broken, so your followers will simply clip through walls. So if you control one while it‚Äôs out of bounds, you‚Äôll get to walk inside the walls.\n\n\n * General performance issues. I didn‚Äôt have much time to profile or optimize much. Let me know if you have any serious problems with performance \n\n* Tiling visual bugs\n\n# DUNGEON MAP (for reference)\n\n![worldmap.png](///raw/8fb/z/1cd05.png)",

But they are not evil -- they just ask for a sacrifice once every century.\n\nThe last one was 99 years ago.\n\nYour quest is to reach the Borks and to make the sacrifice and give humans one more century of existence. Legends say you may need to make other sacrifices on your way...\n\n![dogfight.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f29d.jpg)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n* This is basically a plain and simple shmup: avoid collisions with other things, shot everything that moves.\n* You can equip your ship with different weapons and subsystems:\n    * Armor protects against all kinds of damage. As armor is lost, you cannot fix it (but you can replace it with a new armor if you find one).\n    * Shields protect against energy weapons (laser and plasma), but not against more physical damage (rockets and collisions). Shields regenerate over time.\n    * Engines make your ship move faster.\n    * You can find much better weapons than your initial Cheap Laser. You have a total of four weapon slots, but one of them (the bomb bay) is basically useless: bombs were forbidden by the Jupiter Convention and thus you'll not find any in the game. (Or do you think this is just an excuse for \"sorry, I didn't have time to implement bombs\"?!)\n* If you have available crew members, you can use them to man weapons and subsystems. Manned things work better (faster fire rate, lower armor damage, faster movement, etc)\n* To equip weapons and subsystems and to assign your crew to them, just enter in the pause/inventory menu.\n\n![inventory.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f29e.jpg)\n\n* To find weapons, subsystems and crew members, just kill some enemies. Sometimes they drop the good stuff.\n* Notice that to take things dropped by enemies you need at least one available cargo slot. You can destroy things in the pause/inventory screen.\n\n![powerup.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a0.jpg)\n\n* Once you get some of this gear, the game should be really easy. In fact, the first few minutes are much harder than the boss fights (which are ridiculously easy). I guess this is a symptom of bad balancing :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\n![boss.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a1.jpg)\n\n* Speaking of bosses, you cannot fight with the last level boss. He might look like an ordinary giant saucer, but in fact he is a Bork. If you a lamb on your cargo bays, you'll automatically sacrifice it and win the game. Otherwise, you'll automatically lose.\n* No biological lambs were harmed to make this game. The one you carry on your ship is a robotic one!\n\n![toll.jpg](///raw/61f/b/z/1f2a2.jpg)\n\n**Controls, in game**\n\n* Move ship: Arrows, WASD, controller D-pad, controller left stick\n* Fire: Space bar, alt, control, shift or the  main controller buttons; each one fires a different weapon\n* Pause/inventory screen: F1, pause on keyboard, pause  or start button on the controller\n\n**Controls, inventory screen**\n\n* Select item: Arrows, controller D-pad, controller left stick\n* For other actions there are on-screen instructions. Just be aware that, in order to swap one equipped item with an item in the cargo slots, you must have the equipped item selected.\n\n**Tools**\n* Engine: [Godot](http://godotengine.org) 3.0.6.\n* Font: [Orbitron](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron), by [Matt McInerney](http://pixelspread.com), [SIL Open Font License 1.1](orbitron-font-license.md).\n* Graphics made with [Krita](https://krita.org).\n* Sound effects made with [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).\n* Music made with [Otomata](http://earslap.com/page/otomata.html).\n* Used a bit of [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for sound editing.\n",

(it may be related to some timers being dependent on frame rates, i'll investigate and try to do a build with this fixed).\n* There are many spelling mistakes.

And how long can you last?\n\n## Instructions\nOn the first screen, press a number to pick your character. I meant to have a much nicer selection mechanism, but I ran out of time.\nIn game, just use your arrow keys to move from room to room. Try to keep the bars for all your resources as high as possible - a bar goes up when you're in its room. Your mood affects how quickly your bars go up, and if any of your bars are in the red that'll really affect your mood.\nOn the final screen, just read what it says and press enter to quit (but not before you share your time!) If you want to play again, just run the game again (a friendly retry option is something else I ran out of time for.\n\n### Things missing\n- Your speakers aren't broken, I just ran out of time to do sound. \n- I haven't fully tested every single way of doing things, so it might be possible to cheese it, though I tried to brute force my around the brute forciest of cheeses, so feel free to take that as a challenge.\n- As I said in the instructions, no friendly wrapping. Something else I ran out of time for.\n\nMade in Python (3.whatever I had installed) and pygame. I've been able to make a Windows exe which I think works, I was having trouble - you'll know if I haven't fixed it because time will fly. For my friends running other OSes download the source code zip, extract it and run *CorporateDrone.py* (you'll need pygame installed, if you don't have that open a terminal and run *pip install pygame*).\n\n(As well as adding the Windows exe, I slightly changed the source code zip - I forgot to set some variables I was using for testing back to what they should be)",

The author does not condone satanism or violence against animals. \n\nThis is a game where you need to invoke Satan, by invoking lesser demons first. You can see it as a mix between cooking mama and Keep talking and nobody explodes.\n\nMy body decided that the ludum dare weekend was a great time to be ill. I managed the most I could but I did prioritize my health. This is why stuff that I wanted in (sound, for example) is absent.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it nonetheless. The interface and goals are a bit obscure and that's part of the gameplay (partly).\n\nThe game is only played with mouse or touch (i recommend the android version)\n\nMade with HaxeFlixel on ArchLinux using vscode as an editor.\nGraphics made with Gimp.\n\n**Known bug:** if you get the same recipe for two demons/Satan, you won't be able to win, just restart the game.

      "Body": "Hi guys,\n\n\nUnfortunatelly I was running out of compo time. Let me explain you why...\n\n\n#---Tale of my 8th Ludum Dare---\n\n1. The theme: \n\n -History: I had a lot of idea with this theme, but I found my ideas too hard for one man and 48 hours. What I think about sacrafice? It's a moral deal for the player. The player can use something with his cons, or not. It's all about the deal of the player. So my ideas were complex role play games. In those case I couldn't implement the whole role role playing system in 48 hours, so I dropped my ideas.\n\n -Implement: It's a sadly thing, but my game doesn't contain too much from this theme. If are you looking for game with hard theme, it won't be your game. The story is the following: You are the mouse, who sacraficed him for the science :) You can't choose from the deals, only you suffer the bad ideas of your professor. The professor has an experiment about how can load you with useless/useful things, and what will be the result of his decide.\n\n2. Programing:\n\n -History: I would have liked to create a game with random dungeon generator (when you check my other games, you see I tried it, but those weren't too good). There are a lot of documentation about labirynth/dungeon generation on the Internet.\nFirst off all, what is the difference between labyrinth and dungeon? The labyrinth contains only paths, but the dungeon contains rooms, too. The most algorithms are using some of binary tree algorithm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree ). When you generate a labyrinth, the meaning of the Mase solving algorithm can be useful for you, too ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm ). What about dungeons? The dungeon algorithms are different because of you have to generate a lot of room, and generate some paths to them. That's all. Isn't it? No, It's not, because you need to solve these maps, too.\n\n -Implementation: I was looking for a good algorithm for that, and I found a great one. It's called BSP alorithm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation ). I used to draw the whole map from a matrix before, so I tought I generate a binary matrix with BSP, and draw it. It sounds easily. You have to know if you use recursive algorithm, that you can be in infinity loop, so if you can avoid a recursive call, you do it. Why is it important? Because if you generate 10 random sized rectangle in a 20*20 sized rectangle, you can't avoid the infinity loop in 100%. My statistic is 400/32... After I finished the algorithm, I realized that there is an another important question in case of random levels: The balance...\n\n3. Arts:\n -History: I had a \"good\" idea: if there are animations between the leveles, it will have more fun. I tought when those animations will have good pixel arts, and the levels have too, the game will be fine.\n\n -Implementation: I created 4 pictures (32x32) about a **** cheese and a mouse(100x200) in 5 hours (4819 pixels/hour)( No it's not the mouse of the cover image). The sadly truth is if I would like to create highly detailed pixel art animation for the videos(3-4 800*600 pictures * 3 video), the task is more than 1195 hours long (if there are the same arts, it will be success in 800 hours). The result looks good. I created 4 cheese, but I haven't time for backgrounds, especially for the game over screen... The \"videos\" are really static, and because of my poor english, I don't know that those are fine ore not.\n\n4. Music:\n -History: I don't like to create musics.\n -Implementation: There is a good silence with sfx. :)\n\n5. The Balance\n -History: The first idea is you can shop things from the professor, but all of the things have a price, because of that you suffer your decides. the As remember, I realized on Sunday, there is no chance to create an interactive system of decide. I tought, here is no goal, or barrier, so it's not a game. Can I balance a random generated map where the player can't decide? the answer is below. \n\n -Implementation: No. I created some goals for the random maps. Because of the randomize, the level 7 can be easier than level 6. I didn't create tutorial screen, because the people don't read it, but I created 4 \"tutorial level\".\n\nEnjoy it!\n\n# ---Instructions---\n\nw,a,s,d - direction\n\np - green action\n\nk - red action\n\nselect - enter\n\n# ---UPDATE---\n03.12 I found some critical issues during the tests, those crashed the browser -\u003e FIXED\n",

These enemies range from various types and the player must be able to beat as much of them as possible. Using the player's weapon will inflict self-damage to the player's lifepoint. Having a lifepoint of 0 will result in a game-over. However, the player is able to slowly regenerate it's lifepoint over time. The player is able to carry one weapon and one special ability. Over time, some drops will appear that will grant the player a new weapon or ability. This however, replaces the current weapon or ability of the player. The player must decide what is worth keeping and what is not. Enemies will spawn at different angles and will surround the player. After a set of rounds, the game will become harder and harder where enemies will hit harder, harder to be destroyed, or that the player will inflict less damage.\n\nThe tools I used is the post-processing stack from Unity and an open-sourced code about sprite glow, (https://github.com/Elringus/SpriteGlow).

The children of each generation will be slightly different in appearance to their parents, and you must choose the child that most closely resembles the original beautiful patriarch. You have a photo for reference, but it degrades over time until it is unrecognizable, and then you must rely on memory.\n\nThe features of a child are split up into head shape, skin color, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Along with these, the size of all the facial features (everything excluding head and skin color) can come in small and large forms. Every difference impacts the overall appearance an equal amount, so keep that in mind (going from the original nose to a smaller version of the same nose is equal in change to going to a different nose of the same size, for example).\n\nHow many generations can you make it through before you squander the beauty of this pure family.\n\n-----\n\n**Tools Used:**\n\n- **Engine** - Unity\n- **Art** - Photoshop\n\n-----\n\nMy first ever submission to Ludum Dare, and my second ever game jam, there was a lot more balancing and polishing that I had hoped to do (including adding music, sound effects, death effects to actually show the \"sacrificing\" of the other sons), but I'm just glad it works.

Luckily you can collect your dead bodies to get back your lost live and continue your search for the right way to the exit.\n\nAttention: You need a real C64 or an emulator like WinVICE to play this game. ~~I'll add more options to play later in the evening.~~\n\nUnfortunaly I'm not able to provide you with a HTML5 version, as I can't get VICE.js to work with gamepad or keyboard. Nonetheless you can download a proper C64 emulator for your system here: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/. \n\n## Running on Windows ##\nDownload WinVICE from above site and unpack the files in a folder of your choise. Copy everything from the Commodore 64-zip (mazeofdeath.zip) into the WinVICE folder. Run *start.bat* to automatically run **Maze of Death** in the emulator. Use numpad to play the game. If you prefer a gamepad go to *Settings \u003e Joystick settings \u003e Joystick settings...* and select your gamepad from the select box of Joystick #2. In this dialog you can also create your personal control scheme.\n\n## Running on other systems ##\nUnfortunaly I can't provide any help to make **Maze of Death** work on OSX or Linux. But steps should be similar.\n\n## Compiling the source ##\nTo compile the source code you need **CBM prg Studio** (http://www.ajordison.co.uk/). Beware: The game is much slower, if compiled from sources. Maze generation takes over a minute, also moving the player is slower. \n\nYou'll need a BASIC compiler for C64 to make the game faster. For **Maze of Death** I used Austrospeed. Other compilers like Basic-Boss or BASIC 64 might also work, but need some compiler directives to run properly. Speed improvements are subtle with other compilers. \n\n![mod_ingame_2.gif](///raw/7e5/a1/z/1bb04.gif)",

Especially after scene load when player busy, leading to buggy behavior allowing the player to escape boundaries.

While jellies are selected you can press `S` or `SPACE` to **split your jellies**, you can only split them if your jellies are big enough.\n\n### More info\nMove your jellies in good position for them to shoot approaching enemies. If you move the jellies over the sacrifice pit they will be sacrificed and heal the pit and add points to high-score, depending on jelly size.

And if you don't think they can diffuse the bomb before the timer ticks down to 0, you can choose to sacrifice them. They will immediately stop diffusing the bomb, and attempt to drive it out of the city, resulting in the fewest civilian casualties possible.

Unfortunately for everyone involved, there's something else in your cargo, and the calculations that filled your tiny ship with fuel didn't take the extra weight into account. \n\n### The Cold Equations\nThis is an adaptation of [\"The Cold Equations\" a 1954 short story by Tom Godwin](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cold-equations/). \"The Cold Equations\" is an excellent science fiction short story that really evokes a strong emotional response. It's probably my favorite sci-fi short story, but I admittedly haven't read very many. Although I have adapted the story, every line of text in this game was written by me, by hand, during the compo. There might be some exchanges in dialogue that are very close because they left a strong impression upon me, but I strove to make this an original adaptation. For those who have read the short story, you may notice that the character names have been changed. It was an accident at first, but I decided to stick with my misremembered names. \n\n### Controls\nThe Cold Equations is controlled entirely by clicking with the mouse. It works very similar to a visual novel. If you're stuck at all, try investigating your cargo. If you're on the desktop version, you can hit 'c' to take a screenshot if you need to show me something. It gets saved in your data path, wherever that is (on Windows that's \\LocalLow\\Cobalt Sky\\The Cold Equations\\ for me, but your experience may vary).\n\n### Tools\n**Engine** Unity 2018.1.0f2 \n\n**Art** Paint.NET and Blender \n\n**Sound** Audacity and Bfxr\n\n\n### Media\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nxJFlYb1ZnI\n \n![180402-010428.png](///raw/297/z/1be9f.png) \n \n![180402-010459.png](///raw/297/z/1bea1.png) \n \n",

If you defeat an element, its music stops playing.\n\n-If you fight all four elements, there will be no sound and everything will be black and white.

The twist is that part of your ship is destroyed upon landing. \n## Gameplay\nThe Game has two possible stages:\n1. Flight\n2. Planetary stationing\n\nGoing from planetary to flying can be done for free, by pressing the launch button. Flight to planetary costs you dearly; one layer of your ship gets destroyed.\n\n\n## Flying\nWhen on the flight screen, you can click around your ship (the red dot in the middle of the screen) to set the direction of the next burn.\n\nThe slider on the side is used to set how quickly the ship should burn it's fuel. There's a button to set the burn speed to zero.\n\nUse the 1-5 keys to set the simulation speed, and use the spacebar to set the simulation speed to zero.\n\nIf you're near enough to a planet, the landing button will appear. There's no penalty to speed differences nor position differences, the landing computer on your ship ensures a decent landing. Well, not really decent, but still.\n## Landing\nWhen landing, you have to choose which direction will enter the atmosphere first. Every part of your ship that's exposed from that side will burn, and you will lose those parts.\n## Ship Control\nShip Control is used to enable and disable specific parts of the ship. It serves little purpose within this version of the game.\n\n## Planetary\nThe planetary screen is a screen from which multiple other screens can be reached. It can also be used to launch the ship again.\nYou can reach the following screens from the planetary screen:\n1. Edit Ship\n2. Buy\n3. Sell\n4. Refuel\n\n## Edit Ship\nThis screen is used to add parts to your ship.  There's no punishment to removing and re-adding parts.\n\n## Buy\nThis screen is used to buy cargo. You click the cargo type you want, and then the cargo bay in which you want to place it.\nEvery time you buy something, the price goes up by fifty.\n## Sell\nThis screen is used to sell cargo. You click the cargo bay you want to sell from. Look in the bottom-right to see what's in there.\nA fee of sixty is subtracted from the buying price. Also, every time you sell something, the price goes down by fifty.\n## Refuel\nThe refuelling button is used to instantly re-add fuel to your ship.\n\n## Prices on all planets screen\nThis screen is used to see what which resource is worth where.\n\n#What if I run out of fuel?\nThen you have to hope you run into a planet. No other outcomes are possible..",

NumPy should be in any Python package manager (e.g. pip).\n\nHere's how to install and run the game in a virtual env.

Play with the arrow keys.  Tab opens a menu when in-game.  Enter selects an item in menus.\n\nSmall advice: if you sacrifice the Rendering, press Tab, Down Arrow, and Enter, to open the menu and restart the level.\n\nFor some reason, Pyxel quits the game when you press Esc, so, don't do that :P\n\n(spoiler: there are two \"endings\" to this game, depending on the choices of sacrifice you made)",

      "Body": "Sacrifices must be made!\n\nEldritchual allows you to step into the role of a cult leader who knows something that your new followers do not; you're going to sacrifice them to summon an ancient eldritch horror. As with any nascent and struggling cult, you must manage the happiness of your cultists while keeping the faith in your cult strong and out of the eyes of the local authorities. And when you are ready to begin the ritual, start tossing your cultists into the sacrificial pit. \n\nThe game does not take long to play, and it is my first LD submission. My goal was to create a complete experience, a manageable project, have simple interactions, and be in a style that I enjoy. The visuals should lighten the dark theme of sacrificing your beloved followers, and nothing in the game ever takes itself too seriously. I tend to enjoy worker-placement board games which influence the basic mechanics of Eldritchual. Oddly, I'm not normally a fan of the Lovecraft horror genre, but this theme and other games and movies I've watched recently just led me there. \n\nWhile there are additional mechanics, polishing, and balancing that I would have liked to include, I made difficult cuts to try to stay on time. \n\nPlease enjoy Eldritchual!\n\n### How to Play\n- Click and Drag to move cultists around. \n- ESC to pause the game and review the tutorial. \n- Sacrifice cultists to progress the ritual!\n\n### Eldritual Game Window\n![SS1.png](///raw/ada/e1/z/1c2c5.png)\n\n### Sample Tutorial Screen\n![SS2.png](///raw/ada/e1/z/1c2ca.png)\n\n### Page Edits\n- *Edit: Moved source to GitHub for future work.

And sad sacrifices mean less sacredness. \n\nSacrifice Management is a mouse-only puzzle game. Just move sacrifices to the altar. Oppositely, you can remove sacrifices from the altar by moving them outside. Each sacrifice has a sacredness point (SP). You own a sacrifice‚Äôs SP when you place it on the altar. On the other hand, sacrifices may have a love and a hate list. If a sacrifice is placed adjacent to another one on its love list, its SP increases (not permanently, only for that positioning - base SP never changes). Similarly, hate decreases SP. You pass the level when you reach the level‚Äôs sacredness limit.\n\nSince levels are generated by an algorithm, you may experience very easy or absurd levels.

At the brink of a complete extinction, only a small village escaped the eyes of the gods, until now.\nBaring the legacy of mankind, it is up to you to aid the small mountain town of Javalonia to please the celestial beings while slowly increasing its population. How long will you last before you too perish?\n\n\n*** For those who do not want to read the entire manual *** : This game is a resource gathering game in the shape of a very minimalistic RTS. The gods will ask you for resources, if you can't comply they will kill your villagers until you sacrifice one to them instead.\n\n## Manual\n\n___\n\n#### CONTROLS\n___\n\n\n\nKey | Action\n--- | --- \nF1 | Show controls overlay\nLeft Click| Select a single unit, confirm position to move to  \nRight Click \u0026 Drag | Select multiple units\nTab | Toggle minimap\nArrow Keys| Move camera\nLeft CTRL + UP/DOWN keys| Follow a villager\n\n___\n\n#### The World\n\n___\n\nRight click on a villager to select him/her. Alternatively you can left click and drag (see image). Then proceed doing the same on a target and select an action. Note that not everything can be farmed, as the Gods do not want you to mess with live trees. \n\n |  |  |  |  |  | \n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n![tree.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8b5.png) | wood  | ![berries.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8f5.png) | food | ![water.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8c8.png)| water \n![rock.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8c3.png) | stone | ![wheat.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d8ed.png)| food | \n\n\n___\n\n#### Villager actions\n\n___\n\nA villager can do multiple things. They have to, the fate of mankind depends on it !!!! To aid you in keeping track of your villagers, you can hold down *** CTRL and the up or down arrow keys ***. This will make the camera follow an individual villager in its endeavour! You can also toggle a minimap using the *** TAB *** key\n\n___\n\n##### Sacrifice\n\n___\n\nYou can sacrifice a villager , should the gods demand so. Or if you are unable to fulfill one of their wishes. By right clicking a villager and selecting sacrifice, the character will find its path back to the altar at the village square.\nVillagers are really your most precious resource however, so be careful ! \n\n                             _Making a sacrifice_\n![sacrifice-small.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d995.gif)\n\n\n___\n\n##### Harvest\n\n___\n\n\nYou can manually specify a resource that should be harvested by a villager. Select one or multiple villagers, then right click your target and select \"Harvest\". Obtaining food is harder than it seems. Berries can be quite rare and the only other option is to tend to the farmland near the village. You can use water to let the crops grow, which can then be harvested for food ! Right click the farmland and water it.\n\n                             _Harvesting a tree_\n![action_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d873.gif)\n\n___\n\n##### Scavenge\n\n___\n\nWhen you are in sudden need of a certain resource, you don't always have the time to manage every target for a villager manually. By selecting \"Scavenge\" you can set a resource type and let the AI handle the gathering for you ! Easy peasy !\n\n___\n\n##### Rest\n\n___\n\nVillagers are also a resource and you will run out if the divine demands keep coming. In order to reproduce, at least *** 2 villagers *** need to be resting in the same house. You can do this by selecting villagers, right clicking a house and selecting rest. If you have ***  at least 50 of each resource *** , there is a chance the villagers will reproduce !\n\n                             _Resting and reproducing_\n![drag_select_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d949.gif)\n\n\n___\n\n##### Notifications\n___\n\nA villager will let you know what it is up to by means of a text bubble. \n\n\nObject| Type \n--- | --- \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_00.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f465.png) | found what I was looking for | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_06.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46b.png) | confused, did you interrupt me?     \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_01.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f466.png) | brought something to the village |  ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_07.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46c.png) | looking for wood\n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_02.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f467.png) | can't reach what you want me to | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_08.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46d.png) | looking for food  \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_03.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f468.png) | there is no resource nearby | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_09.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46e.png) | looking for water \n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_04.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f469.png) | thinking about what I need to do | ![StatusIcons_Animation 1_10.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46f.png) | looking for gold\n![StatusIcons_Animation 1_05.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1f46a.png) | sick, something went wrong | \n\n___\n\n#### Events\n\n___\n\n##### Rewards\n\n___\n\n![idol.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d952.png)\n\nThe Gods will bestow you with fortune or will demand sacrifices to be made. In the former, an idol will spawn on the map. Have one of your villagers obtain it before time runs out and you will be rewarded with a random resource ! \n\n___\n\n##### Punishments \n\n___\n\nYou are a toy. The Gods will put you in place with plagues and disaster. You can bribe them by following their demands, by clicking the appropriate button in the HUD (if you have the resources). Be sure to do so before the pentagon timer runs out, the consequences might be severe...\n\n![hud.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1d98f.png)\n\nPlague| Flood | Earthquake\n--- | --- | ---\n![flies_smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d9ef.gif) | ![flood-resize.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1d9f4.gif) | ![quake-smaller.gif](///raw/12b/31/z/1da01.gif)\n\n___\n\n\n## Special Features\n\n___\n\n### Procedural Audio\n\n___\n\nThe audio for this game is procedural. It is generated on the spot and to prove that, there is a function in the options window that can swap between the generated music and piano music on the fly !\n\n___\n\n### Automated resource gathering state machine\n\n___\n\nI've spent almost a full day on this and it still is not working as well as I want it to. It is surprisingly difficult to instruct an AI to be confused at times !\n\n___\n\n### Pixel art\n\n___\n\nAll pixel art was created by me using only 3 gray tones from the Arne64's preset in Pyxel Edit !\n\n___\n\n## Used Software \n\n___\n\n* Audacity\n* Pxyel Edit\n* Unity2018.2.15f1 and Visual Studio 2017\n* sfbgames.com/chiptone/\n\n___\n\n## Developer's note\n\n___\n![drjavasaurus.png](///raw/12b/31/z/1da91.png)\n\n\nI have been doing game development as a hobby for the last two years now. I am not a \"project finisher\", but I am an avid prototyper. I wanted to take the challenge and put as much in this game as I could, using a slice of my skills to deliver the best I could in 2 days. I had tremendous fun writing an overly complex game with simple gameplay mechanics. In a way, I created a chainsaw to carve a chicken, breaking the code more than I fixed it. Resource gathering AI and procedural music in 2 days, with loads of side challenges (drag select, delegate events, ... )\n\nThank you for reading this page, that in itself is appreciation! \n\nThank you for the Ludum Dare community. Every issue is a blast ! And I would also like to thank the Twitch community for the fun streams, even early in the morning. Mic-less mind you, as I did not want to wake my son with my crazyness. Yet you guys stuck by my side and cheered me on ! \n\nAlso thanks for the streams that motivated me and helped me finish the project with laughs and enjoyment.\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/honestdangames ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/rocknightstudios ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/akouo_studios ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/wobblytrout ***\n\n*** https://www.twitch.tv/krassenstein ***\n\n\nUntill next edition, you can find me at *** _https://www.twitch.tv/DrJavaSaurus_ *** !\n\n___\n\n                            Thank you for your time and effort playing the game. Happy gaming and happy holidays !\n\n\n___\n___\n___",

The more that is  broken, the faster \nyou will generate points.\n\n**Preserving your 400 tile world:**\n\nFiring a blob at a location or enemy \nwill destroy up to 4 tiles in a chain \naround that location, adding them to \nyour reserve pool.\n\nAny pit you approach will be repaired\nautomatically using a tile from your\nreserve pool, unless that hole opens up\nright beneath you.  Be careful not to \nshoot anything too close, or you might\ntake a sudden trip to the abyss!  Though \ntrying to walk over a pit with no reserve\ntiles will achieve the same effect.\n\n**The MUNCHARS:**\n\nMunchars love to eat reserve tiles.  So\nmuch so, that they'll show up every 5\nseconds to try and eat yours!\n\nBe cautious, as being bitten by the \nMunchars will eat  10  of  your reserve\ntiles.  You can blob them directly, but \npopping them with a direct hit will destroy\n2 tiles from your reserve pool.  Lose too \nmany tiles and you may find yourself out \nof replacement tiles, with a lot less \nground to stand on, and with slower or no \npoint gains!\n\nFortunately the Munchars are none\ntoo bright, and will walk right into any\npit between you and them.  Have them \ntake the plunge to avoid losing any of \nyour reserve tiles.\n\nBeware how much land you sacrifice, as \nMunchars will be far more likely to \nsurprise you if you don't leave yourself \nsome breathing room!

You can control their work speed, and you'll need to if you want to reach deadlines.\n\nBut this is a double edged sword, since they stress out more quickly when working at faster speeds. Be sure to manage their stress, though some workers benefit under pressure.\n\nA few things I left out: Employees were originally going to be able to come in to work sick (and they'd have a .5 efficiency multiplier tacked on), and they'd have a possibility of getting other employees sick. This also gave the player the choice to send them home, though this severely cuts down on the amount of work that'd get done that day. In the end, I left it out due to time constraints.\n\nOh, yeah. Sacrificed two whole days to make this instead of working on finals. Smart decision? Probably not.

Sick of serving humans, you steal a jetpack and a blaster arm and make a run for freedom!\n\nSadly, the only way out is through the toll tunnels. Avoid the security saucers and their bombs. The tunnel doors open with a switch ‚Äì shoot or press it to move onward. \n\n![PlayShot.png](///raw/c66/z/1c817.png)\n\n## Game:\nThis is a keyboard and mouse shooter/mover game. You need to navigate through five domes to make it outside to safety. The trick: each dome is accessed by a toll tunnel that requires you to sacrifice one of your body parts as scrap metal. As you get whittled down piece by piece, the enemies and obstacles grow more numerous.\n\n## Theme: \nThe \"Sacrifices Must Be Made\" theme is baked directly into the mechanics - you have to sacrifice your body parts to proceed.\n\n## Tools:\nUnity and Visual Studio environments for development, GoldWave Audio and my mouth for sound, PowerPoint and Gimp for art, SoundTrap.com for music. Font is Enemy Sub and Enemy Sub Thin by Zapato Productions:\nhttps://zapatopi.net/fonts/\n\n![Instructions.png](///raw/c66/z/1c897.png)\n\n## Bugfix:\nThe WebGL version (unlike in the Unity client) was creating some glitches where the player couldn't move properly. In order to make the game playable, I edited the movement code to get around the WebGL client issue. I also fixed two other minor glitches:\n1. Sometimes there would be extra level signs\n2. Sometimes even if you scrapped your head, it would still appear on your droid\n\nI've left the original version up as well if you want to play the broken one. Because this is a playability issue, and because no features were added, the fixes are within the rules of the competition.",

This was made in Rust using the ggez game engine, and is pretty much the first thing I've ever done in Rust. \n\nI was originally planning on an inventory management arena game, but that proved to be much too large a scope for me seeing as I was learning the language and the engine. Late last night (technically today) I ditched that idea after spending most of my time just learning an engine called \"Piston\" which was ditched along with my original idea. Today I spent using the simpler engine \"ggez\" to scrape something together, but it is probably the type of project you put together in an hour for most people. Let's just say I'm looking forward to other people's games.\n\nI recommend turning down your volume.\n\nNOTE: You may need to have an audio device connected or the game crashes trying to initialize the sound system.

However, your un-shielded ship will explode if it takes so much as a scratch from an asteroid. Thankfully, the asteroid field is also teeming with chunks of armor that you can also pick up, store, and use to absorb a hit. \n\nYou can manage the relative sizes of your gold and armor bays, but don't get too greedy! \n\nThis is really 2 games in 1:\n\n* The top half of the screen is a simple infinite runner: use A/D or Left/Right to dodge asteroids while picking up Gold and Armor pieces. \n\n* The bottom half of the screen is a view of your ship's airlock, and cargo bays for armor and gold. Once an armor/gold piece enters the airlock, you must click and drag it to the proper cargo bay. You cannot pick up another item until the airlock is empty. \n\n* As you fill up the gold cargo bay, you may feel like you're running out of space. This is when you should drag the cargo bay divider to expand the gold cargo bay. Of course,  that will give you less room for armor.... So you better be on top of your flying, hot shot!\n\n\n## About Me:\n\nThis was my fourth LD game and I really enjoyed it again. The game was made in about 31 hours, because I will be busy all Sunday, and I'm very pleased with the game I made in the abridged time. I am happy the dragging mechanism seems fun and more or less reliable. \n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n",

This game I will extend in the future, I have a plan with local multiplaler or maybe I will do some experiment with online.\n\nIn this game you are in arena and your goal is to live as much long as possile. You can control the game by arrow keys or with your gamepad. (tested with PS4 with \"DS4Windows\" software). You have to dodge from enemy and its follower.Score is time you were able to resist. Fortunately minions are stupid and sometimes they get stuck.\n\nI really enjoy the time and I want to continue working with this idea.\n\n\n",

Data is coming into your storage medium in the form of data blocks, and you must make efficient use of the available space to store as much data as possible before your space completely runs out!\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/93a/z/15cdd.png)\n\n# How to play\n\n- Data blocks (each worth 1 MB of data) appear in the area periodically; this will speed up very gradually over time.\n- Use the trigger on the left and right controllers to pick up data blocks, and release the trigger to drop them.\n- While holding two cubes of the same color, you can touch them together to merge them; they take up the same volume, but can still make more efficient use of space.\n- If any block touches the barrier above the play area, the game ends, and your score is displayed (the number of megabytes of data you managed to store).\n\n![ss3.png](///raw/93a/z/15cde.png)\n\n# Notes\n\n- Try not to push blocks through each other, as it can launch one of them, typically resulting in an immediate loss when it crosses the barrier.\n- It's possible to push blocks through walls, but don't do it.  At worst, the block will stay in the play area but become completely uninteractable.  At best, the game will realize a block has left the play area, resulting in an immediate game over.\n- This has not been tested with any VR system other than the HTC Vive.  That's not to say it won't work, however, so if you have another VR system and can test it, let me know the results in the comments.  *Update* A user has tested it on the Rift and confirms that it works fine!\n\n# Tools Used\n\n- Programming:  Unity 2018 (uses SteamVR assets from Unity Asset Store only for VR setup)\n- Graphics:  Adobe Animate (just to draw a single texture normal)\n- Sound:  GoldWave, Voicemod\n- Music:  Reaper, Vocaloid 4\n",

      "Body": "Hey guys, I am new to this competition and bring this little product.\nI don't want to be boring, so let's make it short:\n\n\u003e\u003e You are a T-Cell in a human body and fight against the cancers.\n\nYa, deadly simple! That's it!\nOf course the mechanism is a bit more complex, but, no worries.\n(If you are bored, then just skip the following lines and download the game)\n\nHere comes's a complete mechanism explanation:\n\n\u003e\u003e 1.  There will be cancer tumors randomly generated in the area every time period.\n\n\u003e\u003e 2.  Cancer tumors will block your way meanwhile some of them will spawn cancer cells.\n\n\u003e\u003e 3.  Cancer cells may rush to you and explode or just swipe, trying to make you dead.\n\n\u003e\u003e 4. You can shoot both tumors and cells but tumors usually takes more damage.\n\n\u003e\u003e 5. You can also call for a Chemotherapy which gives a map-range attack, but be careful -- this will hurt you too!\n\n\u003e\u003e 6. You just can't win.\n\nAnd now let me explain, well, the assets I created (due to competition policies).\nSo, let's first begin with audios.\nIt is my first time so I am really deadline-catching. I soon figured out that I have not much time for musics, so you can see there are only two sound effects. The gun shot sound is a bit weird because it was created by swiping my bath towel real fast. And the blood splatter sound was from drinking Orange Finda. Haha, creative as I am. The BGM is somewhat my favorite factor of this game. I used Garageband and only spend 3 hours to get the final product. Quite Japanese style right? I got the original idea from BioHazard, then came out this stuff. Hope you guys like it.\n\nAbout art, no, my pain!\nAs you are going to see, there are only cubic stuffs in the game. This is because they are all created by the primitive cube meshes. What's more? There is also no animation. I hate to use animations, making the process unpredictable and debug-unfriendly. I code all the animation work -- lerp, slerp, damp, then everything is in control but wasted quite a lot of time. Most of the textures, or the ui sprites in the game were created through PowerPoint. I am a good PPT artist. The only thing that was difficult was the blood splatter pattern. I tried multiples ways, and finally I procedurally processed the texture from the Photoshop (you know, combinations of different brushes), sharpen the edge just a little bit. So you could see the resolution is terrible.\n\nThen the source code. Cinemachine is what I used for Unity's camera management, and I also learned some new knowledges of it this time. The movement of the enemies comes from the new Unity Navigation sets. It is way more convenient than before -- such as runtime baking which is extremely helpful this time. The optimization of this game isn't too bad. I mean, I try to pool everything that I can -- explosions, particles, bullets, enemies -- but you will understand my pain if you could insist for several minutes in the game.\n\nI really enjoyed this match. I was first killed by the theme because I thought that it was too limited. Soon, just half an hour later, I came up with this idea. But time, emmm, really a catchy thing. It is now 4 am in the morning in my country, and I'm a high school student and no sleep. Jesus, I even have another report to hand in this afternoon. Why so unfair\u003e\u003e\u003ejust kidding, but I did get entertained by the experience, hope you guys too! Good luck to all the participants! Maybe you could get a nice ranking, who knows?\n\nFinally!\nRead after me \u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\nBloody Hell? Bloody Cell!\n\nNow, enjoy your time!!!\n\n**Why No WebGL Build?**\n\nI've tried to build one but found two issues. One is that the initial loading time is toooooo long -- about 4~5 minutes, which is pretty enough for a download.\nThe second thing is that there is performance issue for runtime navigation calculating. I experienced regular stuck during playing. Therefore, I gave up to offer a html version. Really sorry for that.\n\n**================ Bug Fix ================**\n1. The UI problem is fixed! No worries for resolution now!\n2. Th bug of Chemotherapy is fixed!\n3. Optimize a bit of the performance!\n4. Player movement bug has been fixed!\n5. Cannot fire after Chemotherapy has been fixed!\n\n**================ Bug Still Exist ================**\n1. Undiscovered yet......\n\n**================ Other Updates ================**\n1.

You actually did win tho :)\n* Don't spam the movement when trying to push an object, this will sometimes get you stuck in an object\n\nOther then that it's bug free, sorry for the bugs!\n\n# Controls\nWASD or Arrow keys to move the player.\n\n# Background\nThis game is made in 48 hours (minus sleeping, eating and going out one night). Ludum Dare 42 is my first ever game jam, and second ever completed game. [This is the first](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.laytangames.awaywithwords). I thought this was a very nice experience and i learned alot about everything in game development, because i mostly make little games or prototypes. This caused me to waste alot of time on actually trying to polish my game and doing scene transitions and all of that.\n\nGet of that damn island still came out pretty cool if you ask me. I am very proud of what i came up with, and i hope that you guys like it. There are some bugs tho, so be sure to read that part asswel. To fix these bugs i would have loved to get like 2 more hours of polishing in, but you know, after those 2 hours i would want even longer. Also one thing i would have done differently is the character controls, they feel very clunky but i sadly got used to them. This caused me to not notice the importance of redoing it.\nThanks for playing!\n\n# Author\n* Laytan Laats\n* [Laytanlaats@hotmail.com](mailto:laytanlaats@hotmail.com)\n* [Github](https://github.com/laytan/)\n\n# Tools\n* Unity \u0026 Visual Studio\n* Photoshop\n* Audacity\n* Bosca Ceoil\n\n# Screenshots\n![ss3.png](///raw/347/81/z/16b31.png)\n\n![Ss1.png](///raw/347/81/z/16b2b.png)\n\n![ss2.png](///raw/347/81/z/16b2f.png)",

But be careful, there is only so much space in your truck to haul it back to the safety of the garage.\n\nThe more you are carrying the slower you accelerate and if you are too full your max speed will be reduced as well.  So it is best to to empty before you get too full.  If you miss science, it will reduce your science score.  If you hit -100%, you lose.  Save 100% science and you win!\n\nYou can tell how full you are to an extent by the color of your truck.  Green is not full, Red is really full, Grey is completely full.\n\nI managed to get in one bonus item, it is the atom looking science that comes flying out.  You can store up to 3 of these bonus items.  Use the Shift key or Fire3 button on your controller to use the bonus.  This will dart you back to the garage super fast.  Very useful when you have a massive load.  If you don't use your bonuses and capture more of them, you will get a large score bonus (not science bonus).\n\nUse the Left Ctrl key or Fire1 button on your controller to brake.  Keep in mind though that you'll have to re-accelerate.\n\nThings I didn't get too:\n- High Scores\n- More bonus items\n- Actual monkey's throwing science.\n- Animated truck... He's a little static and boring, sorry.\n\nThere are probably a few bugs.  I completed everything in the game myself and that is why you get terrible art assets :)\n\nI feel decently good about the sound this time around.  The game itself is meeting most of what I expected to get to so I'm pretty happy about that too.\n\nI'm trying out DropBox for the Source and Executable this time around.

If not, the HTML5 version should work in most/all modern browsers.\n\n![Title_Small.png](///raw/384/z/16ee2.png)",

      "Body": "### \"Power walk to the edge of the universe\"\n\nFor LD42 I decided to take a literal approach to the theme. In \"Edge Runner\" you literraly need to run out of space. No like you need to run to the edge of the universe and actually physically run out of space. You get it.\n\nAnyways, I am super proud with the result of my game this time around. I tried to make a game mechanic as simple as I could and have it fully complete with art, audio, and gameplay. While I wasn't able to get any art put into the game, I feel that the rest of the product is as complete as I would have hoped. \n\nThe only thing that didn't work out at the last minute was a short video that is supposed to play at the end. I guess Unity WebGL has some incompatibilities with it. So, if you want the *full* experience, feel free to download the executable of the game. Fortunately the video isn't that important to the overall game and the gimmick at the end still works without it.

So, the graphics are locked to the CGA 1 High palette, which restricts me to using black, white, cyan, and magenta for all of the graphics in the game. The sound is locked to something close to the Tandy 3 Voice sound card, which is a card that allows for 3 square wave channels. I tweaked the limitations a bit to let me use one of the square channels as a noise channel, allowing for simple percussion. The sound effects are limited to simple one channel square or noise beeps. I'm essentially trying to make this look and sound like a game that looks like it would be played on an old DOS computer.\n\nAny questions? Contact me on twitter https://twitter.com/jono953",

Your job is to make sure that none of your customer's phones ever run out of space.

If their phones fill up, they'll take their business elsewhere.

Honestly, I have no idea, but I know that \"*all*\" can relate to anything. Your code quality as Ludum Dare progresses? Oh yeah, definitely. Same applies to your sanity? Yep, that's for sure. Your life? Yes, but hopefully not...\n\nIt's All Falling Apart Like ... is a game about controlling a thing with keys that can pick up good things and kill bad things oh and all the things also can jump and a lot more... This game... maybe it's a platformer, maybe it's a tower defense (or maybe it's a plane?), maybe it has battle royale elements to it or maybe I just believe that it does...\n \nThe platforms on each level are collapsing under the deepness of the subtle plot... You need to try your best to survive.\n \nDo you see how many ellipses I'm using? Am I doing this for a joke? I don't know. You'll have to find out for yourself... Yeah... This is truly something...

Well imagine this is like a mineshaft, so the falling wooden platforms actually make sense now. Simple‚Ñ¢*\n- 3 unique levels, *the ones you've never seen before. Because you've never seen this game. I recommend, 9/10, but needs more procedural generation*\n- Replay value, *tons of it. You can play with your eyes closed, or maybe with your monitor upside down. Possibilities are endless, really*\n- 3 powerups, *those are things that do good things for you. These can be the key to survival, no joke, especially when used by a real player and not by an enemy*\n- Smart enemies, *those are things that do no good things for you. **HEY, LOOK, THEY ARE SMART, ALRIGHT??? THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO COMPETE WITH YOU. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT YOU HAVE A BRAIN AND THEY HAVE ONLY 650 LINES OF SPAGHETTI CODE WRITTEN BY A DRUNK CODER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU DIE YOU GET TO ENJOY ENEMIES PLAYING ALL BY THEMSELVES. HA. HAHA. THEY ARE FULLY INDEPENDENT AND DON'T NEED YOU*** üí™üò§\n- Realistic combat, *this is basically your typical battle royale game, but it can be played on a potato calculator without Internet connection. Seriously, you aren't eager to play it yet?*\n  \n___  \n   \nüéÆ **Controls:**\n- Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows - Move the landing spot target\n- Space - Jump to the landing spot target\n- Left Mouse - Pan a camera around when player is dead\n- R - Quick restart\n- 1/2/3 - Use powerups if available\n- Escape - Close the game  \n  \n___  \n  \nüïπ **Cheats:**  \nIf for some reason you find enemy bots beating you then:\n1. don't get frustrated \n2. git gud \n3. if you still get frustrated use these: \n - Page Up - Goes to the next level\n - Page Down - Goes to the previous level\n - P - Gives infinite number of powerups\n  \n___  \n  \nüé• **Timelapse:** \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GnB7wELpUc\n  \n___\n  \n*NOTE: HTML5 version of the game might run slow since this was made in GameMaker:Studio, which isn't optimized for HTML5 at all*",

You have a little bit more than one minute to do the work. First levels explain the main gameplay.

      "Body": "A massive star is rapidly gaining mass...\nYour only hope is to \"Run\" \"Out\" of \"Space\"\ngood luck runner\n\nThis is a space \"runner\" type game where a central \"star\" is increasing in size exponentially. The runner (player, red dot) must build up speed by circling around planets, direction controlled by A and D keys. The short red line emerging from the runner indicates current velocity, which may differ from direction of acceleration. All bodies are involved in gravitational calculations, which means planets interact with one another in proportion to their sizes and densities. The star, though, is fixed at the origin of the \"galaxy\". The runner is free under the gravity system when off-planet, except for the thrusters. Unfortunately I ran out of time to try and add a graphical indication of the thruster direction, but know that when in space acceleration will always be towards the top of the screen. On planet surface, acceleration only happens in tangent to the planet's surface, and the view is fixed so \"down\" is always towards the planet. This means there are some sharp camera movements at the transition between on and off planet, but this is better than a fixed viewport, which was making me dizzy :)\n\n(EDIT)\nCONTROLS:\n\nOn-planet:\n- (A) to accelerate LEFT (CCW)\n- (D) to accelerate RIGHT (CW)\n- (SPACE) to jump (Build up speed first!)\n\nOff-planet:\n- (LMB/Mouse 1) to apply thruster (towards TOP)\n- (A)/(D) to rotate view in respective directions\n- (SPACE) will place you on surface of planet when VERY near to its surface (hardly necessary, same effect as just hitting the surface)\n\nGeneral:\n- (ESC) to exit to menu/quit from menu\n- (ENTER) to start new game from menu\n\nI think this is most of the info relevant to playing this game. There is no score, and no objective. There is only one ending, which is somewhat of an inevitability (much like life? :] ). Still, have fun and please tell me what you think!\n\nxox\n(edited) gameplay video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psV4jnlRogk\n\nLinux and Windows build java jar download below, Java 9 may be required (I say may because I have not tested with Java 8, anything earlier will certainly not work, though if you have Java 8 and would like to try building it yourself, this may be an option too. I don't believe I have used any language features not present in Java 8, but I only have 9 on my systems)\nMaven project file can be compiled for other OSs, may try to get other platform specific builds out\n\nMany global settings can be modified if you chose to compile the source yourself. These settings are stored in Settings.java\nModifying these settings may result in more balanced gameplay. I did not have much time to fine tune, though all settings are within a reasonable ballpark of playability. I'm considering a post-compo version with the added feature of in-menu customization. \"RUNNER\" settings affect player attributes. If you want to customize gameplay, these are the settings you will most likely want to change. Most other settings affect the mechanics of the physics system more than anything, which can be interesting but is tough to know how it will affect gameplay. If you tweak these settings, let me know! I'd love to hear what sorts of results you may get.\n\nSource can be compiled by opening the source directory as a maven project in eclipse, and running as maven build with goal argument: \"assembly:single\"\n\nKnown bugs:\n\n- will crash after running too long on one load, due to an exception I forgot to handle. Only happens when all the planets are gone, which takes a little while\n\n- windows build seemed to ignore vsync (at least on my laptop) which is not horribly problematic but can cause choppiness\n\nUPDATE: tweaks to global constants and bugfix in text renderer\n![Screenshot (81).png](///raw/9c1/91/z/1729d.png)![Screenshot from 2018-08-12 21-56-05.png](///raw/9c1/91/z/1724f.png)![Screenshot from 2018-08-12 17-21-33.png](///raw/9c1/91/z/17250.png)![Screenshot from 2018-08-12 22-07-03.png](///raw/9c1/91/z/17251.png)![Screenshot from 2018-08-12 21-58-00.png](///raw/9c1/91/z/17252.png)",

I've been playing around with game design on and off between schoolwork, but never really had the time to commit to a project. The goal was to make a super fast paced platformer, I managed to finish 12 levels. Everything in the game is made during the 48 hours of the game jam, no extra assets were imported or used.\n\nThe goal is simple, jump towards the portal.\n\nYou control the character with the mouse, clicking jumps towards the mouse, right clicking uses a power (there are two of them) and consumes it. Can you reach the portal before the lava catches up? Watch out for the fire beams and cutting wheels along the way! And when you finally feel like you've avoided it all, gravity changes!\n\nThe shifting power creates quite a few bugs that I did not polish out, things like you should die when stuck in a wall or a kill box would have made this game a lot better. I did not get to the dying inside walls and forgot the killbox sadly. If you run into either of these bugs just press R to restart the level. My apologies for this, being my first compo, I may have tried a scope a little wide.\n\n![ezgif.com-video-to-gif (2).gif](///raw/bc2/91/z/16641.gif)\n\n**Controls:**\n\nLeft mouse: Jump\n\nRight mouse: Use Power\n\nLeft/Right arrow key or A/D: Move while not jumping\n\nR: Restart level\n\n\n**Tools used:**\n\nAudacity to record sound\n\nBusca ceoil to create the sound track\n\nUnity3D to creat the game\n\nAsesprite to create the artwork\n\nPaint.net to do some things Asesprite lacks\n\n\n",

Some levels may require you to have the percentage of wires exposed be less than the percentage listed, while others require you to have more.\n* You must connect up all of the output and input ports, which is shown on the right.

      "Body": "\"The keys to your farm have been stolen. You will need to track down the thieves if you ever want to enter your house again.\"\n\nThis is a small adventure game where the hero needs to find and reclaim the keys to win the game. However, without any pockets, he can only carry two items at a time, one in each hand. Gather food and upgrade him to complete your quest.\n\nYou can control the hero with the following keys:\n\nOut of combat:\n- WASD                -\u003e Movement\n- Space               -\u003e Jump\n- Left mouse          -\u003e Grab items\n- Right mouse         -\u003e Target enemy and swtich to combat mode. You need to hold down the right mouse button.\n- Middle mouse button -\u003e Show the way home. Hold down like the right mouse button.\n\n\nIn Combat:\n- W          -\u003e Advance towards opponent.\n- AD         -\u003e Circle opponent.\n- Left Click -\u003e Attack\n\n\nNote: All keys can be rebound in the startup screen. Gamepad will also work, but wasn't tested a lot.\n\nThe enemy doesn't attack due to various reasons. Also, enemies that will drop items will have the item equiped on their back. Apples are used to upgrade your abilities and keys are needed to win. There is a start of a tutorial in the game, but not all controls are explained. \n\nTips:\n- Items will have a purple glow so you can find them when they drop in the grass and enemies are finite. There are more than enough apples to fully upgrade if you want. \n\n- The skeletons carrying the keys are spawned from the start of the game and are visible at large distances. Normal skeletons spawn when you get close to their start and will remain in the area.\n\n- When you enter combat you will drop the two items you hold in your hands, but not the items you carry on your body. Upgrading your carry capacity will really speed up the game as you can do this up to four time, for six items max.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPost dare update:\nEnemies will flash green when hit.\nBeams of light will indicate the general location of missing keys while holding down the left mouse button when not in combat.\n\nNote:\nFor voting, please use the original release, or ignore the new features. Both features will make the game quite a bit more playable.\n\n",

I'm not able to replicate this problem, so I need assistance in fixing it.  The joys of creating your own engine. :)\n\nUpdate: I've located and fixed this problem.  It occurred when running from the Itch app.  I've uploaded a new version (LudumDareToBeMessy.3.zip) that fixes this.  Please let me know if any problems persist.  Thanks!",

Actually, I'm not really sure what they are-- they shoot out lots of fire, but they don't really look like flamethrowers to me. Regardless, you should avoid them at all costs!\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- There are three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Easy gives infinity lives, Normal gives four, and Hard gives just one.\n\n- Checkpoints are spread throughout the game. There's no indicator of when one has been reached, but just remember that they *are* there and you don't have to worry about doing flawless.\n\nIf you come across a bug or anything that seems out of place, please let me know so I can try to fix it!\n\n\n**Credits:**\n\nArt, Music and Programming: Hunter Towe\n\nFont: [Forced Square](https://www.dafont.com/forced-square.font) by [DrawPerfect](https://www.dafont.com/paul-ijsendoorn.d2557)\n\n[BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/) was used to make all of the music\n\n[Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) and [LabChirp](http://labbed.net/software/labchirp/) were used to make all of the sound effects\n\nThis game was made with Unity\n\n**Updates:**\n\nv0.1.2 Release Notes:\n - Fixed wall being able to out speed the player\n - Improved collision with obstacles\n - Got rid of spacing between tiles\n - Eliminated a lot of the jittery movement (there's still some, but it's not nearly as bad as before)\n - Players can now toggle fullscreen mode\n\nv0.1.3 Release Notes:\n - Improved collision with the fire obstacles\n\nv0.1.4 Release Notes:\n - Significantly improved collision with the fire obstacles\n - Probably fixed bug where fire particles sometimes wouldn't spawn\n - Fixed bug where fire obstacles would take two lives instead of one\n - Added an extra checkpoint in the final area\n___",

How long can you last? \n\nBig thanks to Icefox for hanging out with me during development and helping me brainstorm. Check out [his compo game too](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/running-in-to-space). Thanks also to anyone who tuned into the development livestream.\n\n# Instructions\n\nI think there's joy in fumbling through an unfamiliar game, and have seen people do that successfully with MWM and have fun.\n\nYou start with a handfull of organs (structures or buildings, in more traditional terms) that collect resources for you, and one central brain that you must keep alive to survive.\n\nOrgans cost water, minerals, and energy. Build them by clicking the buttons along the side, then mousing over an open area and hitting space to place. The display in the top center will show you the costs of the selected organ.\n\nMinerals come from putting roots in soil, water primairly is collected in falling drops, and energy is produced by special organs.\n\nYou have a limited ability to store resources, which can be expanded with special organs.\n\nYellow/green 'pollen' falls from the sky in ever-growing waves to damage your organs, you must defend, rebuild, and heal from the damage to survive. \n\n\nThere's a bug I've observed but not identified with placement where it sometimes will not allow you to place organs that you should be able to. Sorry about that.\n\n\nEngine: Unity 2018 \n\nTools: Audacity, Krita\n\n\nPOST DEADLINE NOTES: Ported to OSX and WebGL. Adjusted resolution scaling to work better on smaller screens.\n\nWebGL build is playable at default resolution but may be better full screened.\n\n\n![Screen0.png](///raw/c5d/d/z/16339.png)\n\n![Screen1.png](///raw/c5d/d/z/1633c.png)\n\n![screens2.png](///raw/c5d/d/z/1633e.png)\n\n![screens3.png](///raw/c5d/d/z/16341.png)",

If the conveyor belts run out of space parcels begin to get damaged. If a conveyor belt only contains damaged parcels and is full it could jam, and you lose the game. This game was made for Ludum Dare 42 Compo \"Running out of space\"  and made in 48 hours. BTW I am @Yayiest here but @dagwoodland on GameJolt and GitHub.\n\n# How To Play\n## Aim\nThe aim of the game is to keep all the conveyor belts free of parcels, by dragging and dropping parcels. If a conveyor belt ‚Äúruns out of space‚Äù for parcels, some parcels will start to become damaged. If all the parcels on a full conveyor belt are damaged the conveyor belt could jam, and you lose the game.\n## Sorting Parcels\nTo get a good score you must correctly sort the parcels, the sorting rules are as follows:\n* If a parcel looks damaged it must always be put in the damaged chute.\n* If a parcel isn‚Äôt damaged, but weighs more than 5kg it must be put in the too heavy chute.\n* If a parcel isn‚Äôt too heavy or damaged, it must go in the normal chute, unless it has a red stamp which must go in the priority chute.\n\nThe game will tell you what you did wrong if you make a mistake, so you should get the hang of it. Good luck! :smiley: \n![Depot 1.jpg](///raw/0bc/71/z/15ee5.jpg)\n\n![Depot 2.jpg](///raw/0bc/71/z/15ee6.jpg)\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/dagwoodland/Depot",

Help people survive or choose to be corrupt and heartless in this short adventure game. And remember even if you run out of space, there's always something you can do to help.\n\nWhy I made this game.\n\nI wanted to bring to light the recent immigrant crisis, but without sounding overly political. So I chose to blend sadness and humor within a minimalistic experience. Exodus Terminus is somewhat of a mockery on how the news portrays immigrants and refugees as just another person with a sad face.

Their motto is: \"You never run out of space\"... We'll see how that goes. There are two endings.\n\nYou can pan the screen with WASD or Alt-Click. Spacebar will advance textboxes.

This was my first Ludum Dare, and also my first completed game.\n\nSource is available on the itch.io page. Linking it here doesn't seem to be working. I'll put it on GitHub soon.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES/BUGS:\n\nThere is a button to pay for a room expansion. It is underneath the build menu at the start of the game. Either close the build menu or pan the camera to see it.\n\nIt is possible to stack gateways/servers on a single room tile by clicking on a specific spot on the tile. This is unintentional and they are not meant to be stacked.\n\nSomeone says 'servers' but means all servers/gateways.\n\nPlease let me know if you find any other issues and I'll add them here.

      "Body": "Get yourself out of space and back onto the terrible planet that you love.\n\nControl with keyboard or gamepad. Make as many landings as you can to maximize your score. The planet terrain gets more extreme as the levels go on.\n\n![capture_001_12082018_083844.png](///raw/c7f/2/z/15fea.png)\n\n![capture_003_12082018_083948.png](///raw/c7f/2/z/15fe8.png)\n\n![capture_005_12082018_084053.png](///raw/c7f/2/z/15fe9.png)\n\nHow to play:\n\nYou start in orbit around a small planet. You want to bring your orbit in until you are close to the planet, then separate your lander from the booster to make your final descent. The lander has more thrust, since it is less massive, but it also has much less fuel, so time your separation carefully. If you've played a space game like Kerbal Space Program or Lunar Lander, it will be familiar. If not, [this video](https://youtu.be/eOMS8Y3ULdY?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0\u0026t=295) talks about a similar landing in KSP. But the basic idea is that if you burn facing away from your current heading you will slow down, and if you slow down your orbit will get lower.\n\nThe camera in this game is always oriented so that the planet is beneath you, so down on the screen is the direction of gravity, and the direction you will need to go to reach land.\n\nYour UI from left to right is:\n\nALT (altitude): Your altitude with maximum being your starting altitude, and minimum being sea level of the planet (note that terrain can be higher than sea level!)\n\nVEL (velocity): Your current heading relative to your viewpoint. If the yellow line is facing right, then you are going clockwise around the planet. If it's facing down, you're heading straight for the surface!\n\nORBIT: A simple map of your position relative to the planet. This view is not adjusted to your perspective.\n\nLVL (level): The current level you're on.\n\nSCORE: How many points you've earned. You earn points for each level you beat, and the more fuel you have left over the more points you earn.\n\nGAS: The amount of fuel left in your current stage. The booster and lander have separate fuel reserves, but the lander has much less, so use it wisely.\n\nControls:\n\nA/D or left arrow/right arrow - Rotate counterclockwise/clockwise\n\nW or up arrow - Thrust\n\nSpace or return - separate the lander from the booster\n\nEscape - return to the main menu",

You have to figure out ways to dispose of the boxes before your house is overrun. \n\nThere's a lot that I wanted to put in the game but didn't have time for, and there's only one way to get rid of the boxes, so you likely won't need to play the game very long to see everything in it's current state. Planned if I continue to work on the game, are things you, the player, can buy on the computer in the office to help get rid of the boxes (such as wood for your fireplace, some sort of shredder, etc.). The catch there would be that those items would come in boxes of their own, which you would have to weigh the cost of in terms of the space available in your house. Also I would want it to have something in the ui that shows how close you are to losing, but I didn't get around to it. There is a debug menu that shows how close you are to losing, though, if you want to see. I think it's a decent idea for a game and wanted to finish it, I just had other things come up that I needed to do and couldn't finish it.\n\n![screenshot-1.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16c4f.png)\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca1.png)\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca3.png)\n\n![screenshot-4.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca6.png)\n\n![screenshot-5.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca8.png)\n\n### Controls\n- **WASD** to move\n- **Mouse** to move camera\n- **LMB** to pick up/drop boxes\n- **F** to fold boxes\n- **F3** to open/close the debug menu\n- **.** to spawn a bunch of boxes quickly (no actual gameplay purpose, just there if you want to see a bunch of boxes)\n\n### Tools\n- Unity 2018\n- Visual Studio Code\n- Blender / ProBuilder\n- PhotoShop\n\nI put a link to the source code, but it's not showing it for me, so here's the link: https://github.com/jasperarmstrong/LD42\n\nAlso, I was only able to test the Mac and Windows builds, but the Linux one should work fine too since it's a Unity game. My computer might just not be good enough, but the game can get kind of laggy when there are a lot of boxes, try turning down the settings in the Unity launcher if that happens.\n\n### Known bugs:\n- Janky collisions.\n- Boxes sometimes clip through the floor and the game will yell at you for littering.\n- The menu doesn't work after a game over, so you have to alt-f4/cmd-q to exit the game when you're done playing.\n- Where the mouse is detected on the menu is slightly off.\n\nI opted out of audio ratings because the game has no audio.",

You always need Space bar to destroy blocks, so don't waste them otherwise you will be running out of **Space** (bar).\n- On the right side you can see the words and spaces that are coming next. Also, it tells story.\n- The words, speed, difficulty will change when you play through it.\n\n## Rule\n- Push the key that correspond to a golden block.\n- If that block is a letter, then it will turn into brown. All non-brown neighbor (left,right,up,down) will turn to golden.\n- If that block is a space bar (a 1x6 bar without text), all brown block and that space bar will be destroyed.\n- If you can't reach any space bar, we will reset the brown blocks.\n- There is a progress bar on top, when it run out of time new block will appear.\n- When the block stuck in the top row, game will over.\n\n## Control\n- Keyboard only\n- Use Enter to join game and restart.\n- Use key 'A' - 'Z', space bar to play.\n- Use Esc to force Game Over.\n\n## Development\n- Engine: http://www.amulet.xyz\n- Sound: SFXR in http://www.amulet.xyz/editor.html\n- Picture: draw by hand using Microsoft Paint\n\n\n\n",

Go now, and good luck!\"  \n\nUse the arrow keys to move. Space to attack. Attacking kills small enemies, reflects projectiles and pushes around bigger enemies.  \nBe careful! Each step you take creates a hole behind you - if you fall, you lose! Enemies will also die if they are pushed into a hole.\n\n# About the development\n\nThis is my entry for the Ludum Dare 42 Compo, following the theme \"Running out of space\".\n\nEven before voting began, I wanted make a game with a Game Boy-like graphical style (4 tones of gray, a resolution of 160x144, the works). I feel the limitations of such a style would make for an interesting challenge, and would give me some direction when drawing the graphics.  \nOne interesting feature I wanted to implement, that would go hand-in-hand with the graphical style, was to allow the player to change the palette used by the game - so one could choose tones of gray or the greenish tones of the Game Boy screen, for example. Unfortunately, technical difficulties meant I had to drop that last idea (read: I didn't have quite enough time to implement it).\n\nOnce the theme was reveled, the idea of exploring a dungeon where each step you make would create a hole quickly came to mind, and seemed like a good fit for the graphic style. I took inspiration from \"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening\" (and other 2D Zelda titles) when designing the crumbling dungeon, giving each gameplay feature (the holes, the attack, the teleporters, etc...) some interesting scenarios to play with. The crumbling floor, however, made balancing very difficult - any required backtracking would represent an incredible spike in difficulty.  \nDesigning a Zelda dungeon in two days (when it probably takes weeks or months for a team of professionals to do the same) was very intimidating, but given the restraints, I am happy with how it came out.\n\nThis time, I also composed the music for the game (rather than tweaking an AI to do it for me) and, while the tunes are short, I am happy with how they came to be. If possible, do give a moment to listen to Agharamish's Battle theme - depending now how long it takes you to beat him, you might not hear the actual melody.\n\nFinally, I'm happy I was able to give the game a proper introduction, title screen, main menu, ending, and even some scripted events! These little details really do make the game feel much more polished.\n\nStill, some things were left out: the game has no sound effects, no ending music, the player gets no upgrades, there's no pause function (oops! This was half implemented, but I forgot about finishing it), the dungeon only has one floor. I though of doing an introductory sequence where the player would approach the castle, but that too was cut.\n\nOverall, I'm glad with the final result. I hope you enjoy it too!\n\nGame Engine: GameMaker Studio 2  \nGraphics: Paint.net, Paint  \nMusic: Bosca Ceoil\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![main_menu.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168d7.png)\n\n![entrance.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168d8.png)\n\n![fight.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168dc.png)\n\n## Help\n\nSo, this game is pretty hard, and you might get lost easily.

      "Body": "Hello there !\n\nThis is my first game jam ever (and the first \"real\" game that I made), so don't expect something great or even slightly good. I made this in around 30 hours (sleep included) using Godot Engine.\nI'd love to hear what you think about it, so don't hesitate to comment below about what could be improved !\n\nWith that said... have fun ! o/\n\n\n![20180814162602_1.jpg](///raw/78c/a1/z/192eb.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Intro\n\n\n\n\nThe galaxy is collapsing. A giant, nightmarish black hole is slowly growing, consuming everything in its path. \nAnd on this path is our own solar system.\n \nYou are an highly advanced A.I operating the Ark, the first faster-than-light colony ship, fitted with hundred of millions of cryogenic pods to carry humans through the depths of space. Yet, it is not enough to carry the entirety of Earth's population, and building the Ark has mostly depleted the planet of its resources. You must colonize other star systems and exploit them in order to upgrade the Ark and further improve its capacity, while fleeing from the ever growing black hole. \n\nOf course, you're not supposed to save everyone... some sacrifices are necessary. Because you're running out of time. And out of space.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\n## Features\n\n\n\n\n- Probe and colonize nearby systems to gather the minerals you will need to upgrade the Ark. The mining speed depends on the population and the mines level, which can also be improved by spending minerals.\n \n- Population will grow over time, depending on the system's habitability. If it is under 40%, population will instead decline. You can terraform the system's planets by spending minerals to increase its habitability.\n\n- After some time, the black hole will arrive. When it approaches a system, it will slowly decrease its habitability until it reaches 0, so evacuate it quickly !\n\n- The systems stats are randomized, so you will require a different strategy at each restart. However, Sol will always have 100% habitability and 0 minerals, so pop left there will grow fast but be utterly useless. \n\n- You only have one ship, so it might be difficult to handle the increasing population. You may have to leave some of them behind to save the rest...\n\n- Keep fleeing upward. You may or may not find a way to escape.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n## Controls\n\n\n\n\n-  Use the MOUSE to interact.\n-  WASD or ARROW KEYS to move the map.\n-  Don't forget to press SPACE or E anytime to pause the game. It will give you more time to plan ahead and navigate through the messy UI.\n-  You can press F to toggle fullscreen, but I heavily advise you AGAINST it. I didn't have enough time to properly scale the UI, it will mess it even more. The text won't be correctly centered either.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n## Changelog\n\n\n#### Disclaimer : I only added small bugfixes and additional platform releases, since both are authorized after the compo ends according to the rules. I didn't add any new feature, and the game is basically the same as it was when I submitted it.\n\n13/08 : Added a Linux and Mac OSX release (didn't test, tell me if it doesn't work). \nMade some bugfixing : sound not properly playing, menu not showing when clicking on another system, black hole danger radius not growing with the hole itself. Fixed pop growth rate. Changed pause key from SPACE to E because of some weird engine bug with the SPACE key.\n\n13/08 : Added back SPACE as a pause key, but you still can use E if you prefer. Fixed a bug where the menus wouldn't close properly.\n\n14/08 : Quickly fixed a minor but game breaking bug where under certain conditions, you could withdraw more population from a system than you actually had there, effectively \"spawning\" free new humans.\n\n\n\n## Known bugs/problems\n\n- The interface. I didn't have enough time to make it more readable before compo's end, but I'm still working on it.\n- You may not be able to interact with some systems. For lack of better solution, moving the camera around usually seems to fix it.\n\nIf you see any bug, don't hesitate to report it in the comments !\n\n![mother_ship_1.png](///raw/78c/a1/z/170d1.png)\n\nTools used :\n\n- Engine : Godot\n\n- Graphics : Aseprite\n\n- Sound : sfxr",

I created the whole game and all the source code, shaders, graphics and sound effects from scratch in 48 hours. Please don't judge the sound effects too harshly, they were made in a rush in the last hour of the game jam. There is no music, sorry I ran out of time before I could make any. The Big Crunch was made using Unity 2018.2.3f1, visual studio community, gimp \u0026 sfxr.\n\nThe concept of The Big Crunch is quite simple. Collide matching planets and stars to compress them together as the universe shrinks. Its basically match 2! With the gameplay itself being quite simple my priority was to make a more well rounded and polished looking game. I have a title screen, in game UI and even a small tutorial. A lot of my time went into making the planets and collisions look as good as possible, not so easy for someone like me who isn't very artistic. \n\nDuring development I wasn't sure about the shrinking mechanic, I had 2 different ideas: The planets and star shrink towards the centre and you lose when 2 collide OR the planets and stars stay in the same place and you lose when the edge of the shrinking universe hits them. In the end I implemented them both as Mode A and Mode B which can be selected from the title screen.\n\n\nIn a rapidly collapsing universe smash and compress planets and stars together before running out of space.\n\n![GameStart.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/16880.png)\n\n![GameZoomed.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/1687a.png)\n\n![Tutorial.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/16884.png)\n\n![GameOver.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/1688a.png)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GDWV7klHeCw\n\nUPDATE: I've added macOS \u0026 HTML5:WebGL builds created from the same source code as the windows version so more of you can play my game.\n\nUPDATE 2: Now that the voting is over I have released an updated version of The Big Crunch with bug fixes and visual improvements.

I missed the previous event, feels good to come back.\n\nI made this game in 5 non-stop hours.Damn.To be honest,I didn't test this game very thoroughly...I hope there's no glitches...\nIf there IS,please let me know.\n\nIncluding cute character and several game modes!\n\nHow 2 play:\nArrow key to move, Z to shoot bullet.Waiting for the power gauge to fill will allow you to shoot a powerful charge shot!\n\nGimmick:\nWhen the enemy shoots the black bullet, it will turn the tile black.If you step on the black tile, your moving speed will be lowered.Dodging enemie's bullets is very difficult in this situation.However, once you defeat an enemy, the explosion caused by its death will turn the blackened tile back to white again.\nYou are running out of space!\nTips:The normal enemy will always run towards you after hitting the wall.You can try the manipulate their movement by using this property!\n\nHard mode:\nPretty much the same as the normal mode, but once you stepped on the black tile, you'll also suffer from constant HP loss...making it VERY difficult.\n\nPacifist mode:\nYou can't attack, the enemy won't respawn...just survive as long as you can.\n\nGod mode:\nInfinite charge shot, black tile barely slows you down...the boss might be stronger, but it's not a problem in this mode.You also have 5 times the HP.\nHowever, there's no score in this mode. This is what you get for playing the CAT GOD.\n\n![sc1.PNG](///raw/1c5/9/z/15e72.png)\n\n![sc2.png](///raw/1c5/9/z/15e74.png)\n\nI also includes the soundtrack for this game in the file!And if you like those songs, be sure to check out my Youtube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiQ4F7WZ5-soYvvgrXEyd1Q\n\nI mainly made Vocaloid English songs.

I made a simple match 3 game.\n\n## Instructions\n\nUse left and right arrows to move from column to column and up and down arrows to shift the current column. Any run of 3 or more of the same color in a column scores you points.\n\n## Technical notes\n\nI built the engine from scratch using HTML5 canvas 2D context. Wrote the whole thing in CoffeeScript.\n\nCreated the music and sound effects using LMMS and some default instrument samples included therein.\n\n## Building from source\n\nThe source code is included so you can build the game yourself using NPM.\n\n```sh\nnpm i\nnpm run build\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nAnd then point your browser to localhost:8080",

Since Ifound out about this competition, I always wanted to participate. \n\nSadly I couldn't finish adding some music, but I'll try to continue the work on this game. Maybe someday it will have some music.\n\nAnyways here is the idea for this game with this Ludum Dares theme \"Running out of space\".\n\nYou start out with three Players. Your goal: keep them alive as long as possible. You'll get Loot from enemies and also from chests. Some of these are useable some are not. Useable items will vanish after they were used, equip items however will not. \n![How_to.png](///raw/0b3/21/z/16de9.png)\n\nThe violet highlighted boxes are where you obtain your loot. If all of these slots are occupied you won't get any new loot. -\u003e Keep them empty!\n\nThe other coloured boxes represent the free storage of the group. Each group Member has 2 colored Columns. Equipable Items can be put there, they will be automatically equipped. You can swap these Items around. However say blue dies and had some sword equipped and you try to equip it on green, you won't get the effect on him. Useable items however can still be used.\n\n\nControls: Mouse only\n\nLeft click: Swap the items in the inventory.\nMiddle click: Shows information for the item.\nRight click: Use the item if it is useable.\n\n\n\n## Update\n\nThank you all for the feedback. I've been working on this game after the competition and I wanted to show you my progress.\n\n![LD42_LimiteLootHuntersProgress.gif](///raw/0b3/21/z/1a680.gif)\n\nThere have been alot of changes and I'm looking forward to add even more to the game.\nChanges that were made:\n- You can now trash items.\n- You can now move the player to the enemy.\n- Each player has his own inventory and equip slots.\n- Animation for loot drops.\n- Graphical overhaul.\n- Skill system - still work in progress.\n\nI have updated the background image and the player sprite.\nHuge thanks to rvros from itch.io (https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero) for providing this awesome payer asset for free and also edermunizz  from itch.io (https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-hill) who provides this great free background asset.",

Fixed a few bugs along the way, hope no one minds. All substantive work was completed by the deadline, I swear. :)\n\n![DerRaumGamePlayGIF-reduced.gif](///raw/660/b/z/17458.gif)\n\nDer Raum is strongly inspired by an arcade game from my youth, the name of which I'm not going to reveal just yet to see if anyone recognizes it. I spent many, many quarters on the game as a teenager. \n\nThe gist of it is you're trapped in an ever-shrinking room and need to get out... and you will, only to find out you're stuck in another room, over and over again, and it's only getting more and more crowded each time.\n\nI have more enemy types partially complete but not playable in the game. The game should be a progression of enemy types, each with their own behaviors. But, since I don't have them all ready, I've opted to let you play one room over and over again, with sliiightly increasing difficulty every runthrough. It does get quite challenging, and eventually, of course, you WILL fail.\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\nAs follows, but note:\n\n**A DUAL-STICK CONTROLLER IS REQUIRED!** (keep reading)\n\n- **Left stick:** *player movement*\n- **Right stick:** *shooting*\n- **Start / A:** *start the game from the title screen*\n- **M on keyboard:** *toggles audio muting on/off*\n\nWhile the arrow keys on the keyboard still work for player movement, this game is controller-based. It's a twin-stick shooter, basically, in my incarnation... although I have limited the firing to eight directions as a hat tip in the general direction of the yet-to-be-revealed arcade original. \n\nAnd for those of you that don't have controllers, I am truly sorry. I'm OK with it being a controller-only game. It was developed and tested with a newer bluetooth-capable Xbox One controller, both via BT and via USB cable. I suspect any reasonably-modern dual-joystick controller would work (old PS2/PS3 controllers, 360 controllers, random Logitechs, etc). If any of you try other joysticks with success, I'd love it if you'd let me know. :)\n\nI created some music using Auxy on my iPad this time. I'm not a musician, and I'm not a composer. It's not exactly the music I had in my head when I was making the game, but I figure something is better than nothing. I'm also not all that wild about most of the sound effects in the game... but again, solo compo participant, limited time, and it's still better to have something than nothing. \n\nI both love and hate that audio can really make or break a game's feel. Hopefully it'll grow on you. I think I'm missing a few sounds here and there, but nothing crazy-important. And again, the M key on the keyboard is there if you hate it all or just wanna quietly play. ;)\n\nI spent a lot more time on art this time, which I'm pretty happy with, though most of it like the majority of the mechanics work, you won't get to see--yet, anyway, I hope.\n\n**TOOLS:**\n\nGame was made with Construct 2:\nhttps://www.scirra.com/construct2\n\nAudio was created using Auxy on iPad, bxfr, and ChipTone.\n \nAuxy:\nhttp://auxy.co/\n\nbfxr:\nhttps://www.bfxr.net/\n\nChipTone:\nhttp://sfbgames.com/chiptone/\n\nImages created in PyxelEdit, with some light MS Paint usage:\nhttps://pyxeledit.com/\n\nProgression tables done via Google Sheets.\n\nGoogle Home streamed \"Code Radio - 24/7 concentration music for programmers\" from freeCodeCamp.org via YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ22pgaXog4\n\nWinSCP used to upload HTML5 code and the various game builds to my website:\nhttps://winscp.net/eng/index.php\n\nIf you find any breaking bugs or other annoyances, or even \\*gasp\\* an Easter egg or two (maybe?)... please let me know. I'd also love ANY other feedback you can offer. \n\nThose that leave a well-intended comment, I'll definitely rate you back! \n\nAnd since my son and his friend were here all weekend making their games, why not reward them with a rating? I'm sure they'd appreciate it, and I'd like to think they'd also rate you back. :)\n\nMy son's game, TENORMS: \nhttps://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/tenorms\n\nHis friend's game, FaceGuy:\nhttps://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/faceguy\n\nThanks for reading this, have a great LD!\n\n-A\n\n---\n**If audio/music doesn't autoplay when you start the game:**\n\nI thought I had a bug, but I'd forgotten that Google changed Chrome to disable the autoplay of video and audio--as many users were annoyed by auto-playing ads. This sadly also affects games.\n\nYou have two options: Hit M twice on the keyboard to toggle the audio off and back on again. Another, more \"permanent\" option is to change the setting in Chrome. This will, however, affect anything that autoplays audio and video, so you may not want to make this change. I wouldn't blame you. However, I'll provide the information and you can do with it as you please.\n\nPut the following into the Chrome address bar:\n\n    chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy\n\nYou'll see the option at the top of the page called \"Autoplay Policy\". From the dropdown to the right, select \"No user gesture is required\". You will likely need to restart your browser.\n\n*If I were you, I'd just double-tap M and leave your browser settings alone.*\n\n---",

I thought of stuff like _Combine_ (tractor) toward incompatible genres, but decided that would be boring. Instead I thought of two **things** that were incompatible. I decided to go with oil and water. I wanted to make a puzzle game around it, so I decided to make a game moving around liquid metal inside water (magnetically). I mainly went with this idea because I really wanted to try making some fluid physics. It was annoying at times, because I did a lot new (played around with shader code etc), but I learned a lot.\n\n# How to play\n\nThe instructions can be found on screen as well.\n\nTo play, click on the screen to repel the liquid away, try to guide it into the holes.\n\nThere are two progress bars on the side, one tells you how much liquid you have left to push out, and the other tells you how much longer you can hold the mouse (you have a limit to make it difficult)\n\nDon't hit into red areas.\n\nGood luck!\n\n# How is this made\n\nThis is made with Lib-GDX, and the physics is done with Box-2D. The liquid is actually a bunch of circles simulated in the physics engine. To make it look like liquid, I blur the whole image a bunch of times in a shader to blend the particles together, then use a shader to not display pixels with a certain darkness, and display other pixels at their full brightness. (The source code is available if you would like to take a look at how it is done)\n\nIt might sound easy to implement (I thought it would be), but as always, I ran into so many issues trying to do so. But luckily, the game turned out great!\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![screeshot1.PNG](///raw/a1/z/10f15.png)\n\n![screeshot2.PNG](///raw/a1/z/10f36.png)\n\n\n[Gif](https://image.ibb.co/gQd3Mx/Liquid_Sample.gif)\n",

Without any communication whatsoever, they open fire, and target your ship's systems, and many crew members are injured. You, the enigmatic engineer wearing a red shirt, must repair the damage done to each system, and pilot the ship to safety.\n\n.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get any time to write a tutorial really, just some tooltips. So here's one.\n\nW = Move forward\n\nA = Turn left\n\nD = Turn right\n\nLeft Arrow = Fire left railgun\n\nUp Arrow = Fire forward railgun\n\nRight Arrow = Fire right railgun\n\n.\n\nThe button on the top-left of your screen will take you to see the panel that's been damaged.\nOnce viewing the engineering panel, everything is fairly self-explanatory. At the top, you have a selection of logic gates you can place, a tool to connect them, and a button to return to the original ship view.\n\nEach logic gate has 2 input terminals(except the NOT gate, that has 1), and an output terminal. The blue circles are inputs, the red circle is the output, and the cross above the output is to delete the logic gate. The same colour scheme applies to the panels' inputs and outputs (left and right terminals respectively).\n\nOnce you click a terminal, you will start dragging a wire. You can right-click to drop it. Each input can only be connected to one output, and each output can only be connected to one input (though the panel terminals on the left can be connected to multiple terminals). Note: I have seen some bugs with this, if you connect an input to multiple outputs or vice versa it probably won't work... you might have to restart the game even ;)\n\nRemember - some circuits are connected to machines that generate a lot of heat. If these are allowed to get too hot, your circuit could get damaged!\n\n.\n\nDEV NOTES:\n\nQuite happy with how this turned out. I would have liked to have added another system and some music, but at least I got some sound effects so that's great. Not entirely sure about the background when flying in ship view, it should probably be a scrolling background of sorts, but oh well.\n\nIn terms of bugs, it's playable. I've double checked that it's possible, but there might be a bug or two still. If you find one please tell me :)\n\nIf you're curious, I made a kind of manual for the circuits. They won't tell you the solution(s), but they go into more detail about what each input/output does and the implications of certain sets of inputs/outputs.\n\nHave fun!",

      "Body": "https://youtu.be/m6Sod8cqRuc  \nSparrow Endive went deep undercover into the world of underground cooking and has gained much popularity in a short amount of time. The reality show High-Stakes Chef has invited Sparrow to compete for the title of master in their prestigious arena. The event has called out rarely seen judges, and one of them is a counter operative. Guide Sparrow through the event, win, and identify the spy. Losing isn't an option. In this competition, you lose, you die.\n### Controls\nMovement: WASD or arrow keys  \nLook: Mouse  \nInteract: Left mouse button  \nSome screens prompt you to press arrow keys.\nEscape will quit out of the game at any time.\n### Playing the game\n**This game takes a little over 12 minutes to play.**  \nYour job is to make four dishes to the satisfaction of the judges. Start at the four staging areas to decide on a style for each dish. Then, follow the list of tasks. You'll need to pick up your dish and station it stations where you need to work on it or pick up ingredients. Gathering ingredients is the same as cooking, the number of ingredients is how many keys you need to hit at the correct station. Make sure you stage each dish and check off a task before you go on to the next task! Some tasks require you to stay at a station when it's cooking, and others you need to leave behind. Pay close attention to the tasks!  \nAfter 2 hours (12 minutes of actual play), the competition is over and your dishes will be judged. If your food isn't made well enough, then your life is over! If you win the competition, you get one chance to grab the counter operative during the closing ceremony. Get the right one, or your cover will be blown! **Note: A minute on the clock is only 6 seconds of play!** I did this so you didn't have to play for two literal hours :)\n### Notes\nI honestly do not know if it's possible to make the dishes in the alotted time. I was unable to get around to doing a full test of the game. If you manage it, let me know!  \nThe Web version **requires** WebGL 2.0, but seems to run pretty well. This means that you need a modern Firefox or Chrome version to run it (sorry). You can check [here](https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/) to see if your browser supports WebGL 2.0. No Mac version this time. At one point I was going to use a library that required the 4.x runtime, but it's not in the game anymore. Sadly, trying to step back down from 4.x crashes the project, so I am leaving it alone. The 4.x runtime means I can't write to Mac, aparently\nPlease let me know if there are problems with audio at all. There is audio, so if you can't hear any **after the cooking starts** then let me know. I've had issues with audio disappearing in past compos.  \nSorry about the box graphics, I just didn't have time to make proper stations. Over time, the look really grew on me, though.\n### Screenshots\n![screenshot-131689131993365415.png](///raw/297/z/10861.png)  \n![screenshot-131689132224328625.png](///raw/297/z/10862.png)  \n![screenshot-131689138757402296.png](///raw/297/z/10864.png)  \n![screenshot-131689138841567110.png](///raw/297/z/10866.png)  \n![screenshot-131689139023097493.png](///raw/297/z/10868.png)  \n![screenshot-131689139455962251.png](///raw/297/z/10869.png)",

      "Body": "# Description\n\nIn *FaSi FiGa* you play as a farmer who is being attacked by a bunch of creatures. These creatures come from the ‚Äòdense‚Äô woods around your small farm. Be on the lookout whilst growing your crops. You might be suprised how quick they arrive once you start watering your plants.\n\n# What to do?\nA quick introduction to the gameplay. Basically you first go ahead and pick up some of the seeds found at the tables near the barn. You bring those to the field and plant them. Atleast one seed has to be planted to start a wave. Upon wave start enemies spawn in the surrounding areas and come targeting the crops you planted. They will attack them and you have to try and defeat them. Which in this build is easy because for some reason every weapon one hits the enemies. Plants grow after they survived a wave. Are they then attacked and ‚Äòkilled‚Äô in a following wave, then they will revert to the previous stage and so on until fully destroyed. If a plant grows fully (stage 4), then you can harvest it which spawns new seeds for you to plant on more spots (as of writing this there is a mistake where only a single seed is harvested making them overall seed count not go up). If all seeds are destroyed you lose the game. If you however manage to plant all seeds and fully grow them you win the game.\n\nWell I still hope you guys enjoy the game a bit. There is not too much to do sadly.\n\n# How to play\n|Action|Key(s)|\n|------|---|\n|Move|WASD|\n|Look|Mouse|\n|Attack|Left Mouse|\n|Pickup|E|\n|Use|F|\n|Drop|G|\n\nTo harvest crops you take the harvester (shovel) and press F on fully grown crops.\n\nTo start a wave you water your plants by pressing the button at the fountain.\n\n# Play\n[WebGL and Windows Versions](https://oneplusonens.itch.io/fasi-figa)\n\n## Known Issues\n- Sometimes colliding with objects bounces you back\n- Killing an enemy very early in a wave ends the wave but still spawns all remaining enemies\n- All Weapons do one hits on enemies\n- Mouse does not lock in WebGL version on itch\n- Able to hit with seeds\n- Enemies sometimes kill plants almost directly (1-2 hits)\n- Enemies animator does not work correctly\n\n## Features I wanted to add\n- Showing which button to press over objects\n- Health bars\n- Cooldown of the weapon delays\n- Much nicer looking surrounding\n- Correctly animating the enemies\n\n## Screenshots\n![Screenshot_22.jpg](///raw/ad7/c/z/1143b.jpg)\n![Screenshot_23.jpg](///raw/ad7/c/z/1143c.jpg)\n![Screenshot_21.jpg](///raw/ad7/c/z/1143e.jpg)\n\n## Development\nWhat a ride, and a chaotic one. First time for me doing the compo. The theme in my opinion really was not that great (the worst from the final round actually) however I still committed to doing it. My idea was to combine a farming simulator with a fighting game, which slowly turned into wave shooter. So in the end farming simulator + wave shooter.\n\n## Day 1\nA very very chaotic start. The first few hours were me trying to come up with an idea. After not coming up with anything I proceeded to use on of those made generators for the theme. It did in fact help me get to the idea that I eventually did. Fast forward a little and I am already deep into programming. I knew I needed a lot of picking up and dropping items (tools, weapons, seeds, etc.). So I made a pickup script. I was so confident that using colliders for this would be the best way to go. Oh boy was I wrong. Well finishing that huge pickup script I lived through the day with very janky pickups :D. I proceeded to lay out the basic shape of the scene and starting making placeholder items which if I look at the game now made it into the final release :P! The rest was just some stuff for the overall visual look and preparing basic movement for the enemeis, so prebaking the area where the NavMehses can walk and already adjusting their settings.\n\n## Day 2\nRight in the first hour I began rewriting the pickup script to use raycasts instead of colliders and triggers. It felt so much more smooth after that. I did think about using raycasts on day 1 and I am honestly not to sure why I didn't do it right from the start. Well carrying on most of day 2 was creating the growing, attacking and overall connections between the different game elements. The code I produced looks asbolutely terrible. To get a baisc idea its like this Script1 calls something on Script2, Script2 then something on Script3, while Script3 goes back to Script1 calls something there and maybe something else on Script2. You probably get the point. Its all a huge cluster****. The rest was mainly doing some nicer models and some particles to make the overall scene more visually appealing.\n\n## Day 2 evening\nWell the evening. Only several hours until the deadline. First I get a bug. Alright no problem let me find it. 1 1/2 hours later I find out I was searching the wrong place all along. Managed to fix it, caused another one (now still present bug, check known issues). Moving on I did my first build. I was confident that I wouldnt get errors cause in the end it was all fairly simple code. Well look at that no errors build is done. I proceed to check the WebGL build and its an empty scene. Turns out because I was using the new lightweight scriptable render pipeline it wasnt rendering anything. That is due to the LSRP only supporting forward rendering whereas WebGL only supports deferred rendering. Well back to changing everything back to the old system. Luckily I didnt have to many assets so it was fairly quick (it did remove my painted grass from the terrain though :( ). Lastly I kinda forgot about winning and losing, because I mainly focused on the gameplay getting done (which is not fully done) I did a lats minute Time.timeScale = 0; so its a very anticlimactic win/loss (sorry :( ).\n\nThe name comes from the genres combined Farming Simulator - Fight Game -\u003e Fa Si Fi Ga :D",

Hopefully, when Firefox 60 is released, this won't be necessary anymore.\n\nRound-Based Real-Time-Strategy game - mash-up between turn-based and real-time.\n\nThis is a two-player game that has to be played on the same screen. Wanted to do real multi-player over the internet, but had no time for the server. Hopefully after compo... By any stretch of imagination this is only a gameplay prototype: simplistic graphics, no music, no sound effects :/\n\n**You can and maybe you should play it on your phone :)**\n\nThe goal is to get your units to the other side of the game field. Place units by selecting one from your selection bar and dragging it on the field. Or just click to select and click to place.\n\n# Units\n\nThe units will move on their own, you have no direct control. They will move to the other side, if not distracted by enemy units. Units of different types behave quite different:\n\n* The tank will ignore all units but the Cannon. He will try to kill the cannon, if he sees it.\n* The Cannon will not move but will distract the Tank and also shoot any ground units.\n* The Shooter Group are 5 little shooters - fast, deadly but easy to kill. They will attack both ground and air units.\n* The Airplane is the only air unit. Most units cannot reach it, while it unleashes a rain of bullets.\n* The Spinner does area damage in a small radius around it. Otherwise it's pretty tough and can act as a small tank.\n* The Impaler has a spear that does enormous amount of damage, although quite slowly. It is fast as well, so can be used as a runner, like the shooters.\n\n# Turns\n\nThe two players take turns. Every turn lasts for only 5 seconds, so be quick. Or you can use the whole turn duration to give your troops some time to hack and slay.\n\n# Cooldown\n\nAfter using a unit, it will be locked for 20 seconds to prevent you from spamming too much of the same units :)\n\nHave fun and leave comments!",

This is a racing game, where you pilot a... plane? Is it a plane??? Or is it a bird? Actually, most likely it's a spaceship. Ah yes, you are piloting a spaceship around the oh-so-familiar racing track with a bunch of barraging projectiles from all the possible directions. Your goal here is simple: get the highest score possible by the end of three laps. Beware though, as the enemies get tougher with each completed lap and crushing into borders of the race track will do you no good.\n  \nKill, collect, dominate and have a blast üí•\n  \n___  \n   \n‚úèÔ∏è **Theme:** Combine 2 Incompatible Genres\n  \n___  \n     \n  \nüèÖ **Features:**\n- *BASICALLY 2 GAMES IN 1. RACING + SHOOTER. BEST DEAL EVER*\n- Several levels of powerful weapons with amazing patterns\n- *DID YOU SEE HOW BIG YOUR SCORES CAN BE? INSANADOS*\n- Colorful and peaceful atmosphere\n- *MAYHEM EVERYWHERE JUST LOOK AT ALL THAT*\n- Replay value\n- Energy bar that allows you to truly unleash your destructing capabilities\n- *THE ENERGY BAR ALSO WORKS AS YOUR HP, SO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DECISIONS*\n- Precise controls that will remind so much of Touhou ‚ù§Ô∏è\n  \n___  \n   \nüéÆ **Controls:**\n- W - Accelerate forward\n- S - Accelerate backward\n- A - Turn left\n- D - Turn right\n- Left Shift - Uses energy to increase firing rate and movement speed\n- Space - Releases a stream of bullets (the more firing power you have the crazier it'll be)\n- Left Mouse - Releases a more powerful bullet which can destroy all the enemies' bullets in its way\n- Right Click - Uses energy to perform THE MOST POWERFUL ATTACK‚Ñ¢Ô∏è\n- Escape - Close the game  \n  \n___  \n  \nüïπ **Cheats:**  \nI find the game to be pretty simple, but sometimes I just want to shoot stuff around me mindlessly, you know? For that I have some cheat codes: \n- 1 - grants infinite energy (the bar at the bottom is always full)\n- 2 - grants maximum firing power (300 out of 300, the sickest attack you will ever see)\n  \n___  \n  \nüé• **Timelapse:** Finally got around to making this\n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAM_QREIcFw  \n  \n___\n  \n*NOTE: MacOS and Linux builds are not tested, so use them at your own risk.*",

Each number on the dice corresponds to a possible move. You can end your turn whenever you want or even wait a turn in order to move when its more apropriate.\n\nNOTE: In order to play you need an internet connection! Game fetchers other players from a a MySQL database. If you win your player will also go into that database ... that way the next players who play it can play against your run.\n\n## Basic Controls and Rules:\n\n\"A\" and \"D\" rotate the camera to the left and right.\n\n\"W\" Zooms In the camera on the player\n\n\"S\" Zooms Out the camera on the player\n\nWhen its your turn to play press \"Space\" to throw the dices\n\nOnce you jump you can move 2 times in the directions available with the arrows. After this you fall down. Note that falling does not remove any move points from your play.\n\n## Button:\n\n-\u003e End Turn: Ends your turn. next player starts playing.\n\n-\u003e Wait: Game turns 1 time without you doing any action.

Can you best the computer across a 3-lap race in this inexplicable  genre match-up?!?!\n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nConsidering the time constraints and crazy LD Theme, I wanted to keep the game's scope small. Ultimately, that lead to some shortcomings. For starters, the usual programmer graphics and sounds/music are in full effect. Additionally, I would have loved to do more with the sound scheme. For example, changing the music's tempo as you complete laps would have been a great idea. I would have also liked to polish the presentation a bit more. For example, the animations turned out to be a bit wonkey by the time I got the WebGL build actually working. And, as it stands, the game is quite limited with just three simple 'modes.'  But, all that said, I kept my requirements creep urges at bay and fought to stay focused on getting out a working game.\n\nNeedless to say, the actual code leaves a bit to be desired. 48 hours means it's time to throw out my software engineering best practices and just start hacking.\n\nBut, overall, I'm happy with what I've accomplished and I'm looking forward to hear what everyone thinks about it! **Thanks for playing :-)** \n\n---\n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity 2017.3\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n* 1998 Fender Toronado\n\n---\n\n## Screen Shots:\n![Combo.png](///raw/03a/d/z/106bd.png)",

I have now included the source code, including the framework I use to make all my games!

Unfortunately I just did not have time to do a Linux build, so it's only partially set up.  The Framework itself is completely cross-platform, so building for Linux should be easy!\n\nIf you have any questions, just ask!

Be careful of the tides!\n\n**[UPDATED] Controls:**\n\nW / S - move forward and back\n\nHOLD E - Speed up day cycle\n\nSPACE - jump\n\n**Tips:**\n\nBarrels float - they can keep you safe or help you get to higher platforms\n\nDon't place barrels on each other during high tide. You'll likely push both barrels away\n\nBe careful of not pushing barrels off their dock, you may need it as a boost to get higher\n\nIt's best to push one barrel at a time and not have two or three back to back\n\nLook at the shadow cast by the daylight. It will show you a 2D layout of the puzzle\n\nNot all docks are above sea level\n\n[Updated] There are now 2 checkpoints - you're welcome\n\n\n**Speedrun - 3:08s**\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RdzRjzgqU7w\n\n![tidalscreenshot2.PNG](///raw/ce8/4/z/11164.png)\n![tidalscreenshot3.PNG](///raw/ce8/4/z/11166.png)\n\nPlease, I love feedback. This is my third LD event and I find every comment helps me improve.\n\nCheck out my other games and apps on my website listed under my portfolio. Can't wait to play all your games as well :)\n",

Find it and turn it on in your cage manager! You can destroy walls, trees and stones to receive the resources on which toys are made. Energy is necessary for your shooting.

Here a classic idea : Seeing what our plat-former heroes see.\nI wanted to do something slightly more narrative, with the hero doing voice comments on the fakeness or the awkardness of the unity scene, etc etc. Something meta.\n\nTo virtual characters, the players are plain ol' voyeurs. Now you know what our platformer heroes see when they look at the camera.\n\nBut as expected I struggled to do simple things as detecting a collision so here I am, with a Sound Design and musics made 2 hours before the end of the jam :D\n\nIn the end, I achieved only a part of my intentions : Doing a game with a Truman-show-side, by making a classic, basic, naive platformer on one side, and then on FPS we can see that all of the world is fake, the landscape is just a plane on the background, etc etc. I wanted to add even more of that side in my game, by showing shadows of the background props on the sky, making the character rant about his fake world, and making pseudo-philosophical statements about our perception our reality and the dimension of choice, etc etc.\n\n...At the end I have, like, 50% of my scope : But I learned 1 or 2 things during the making of it so I guess that's okay. Okay, who wanna play ?\n\n\n\n\n\nPS : Sorry fur bad englanch : did not sleep much recently. :D\n",

Every other card has a pretty immediate and obvious effect, so they should be self-explanatory.\n\nScreenshot:\n![ss1b.png](///raw/dd3/z/1184c.png)\n\nPost-compo change note: Though I had saving and recording of high scores to my server in before the end of the compo, it took me an extra 30 minutes to actually get the *display* of high scores in-game, so ignore the High Score screen for judging purposes (but do *not* ignore it for compete-against-your-friends purposes ;).\n\n\n--\n\nTools Used\n* Custom Engine: [GLOV.js](https://github.com/Jimbly/turbulenz-playground)\n* Mtn Dew\n* Some tiles in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)\n* Image postprocessing in Photoshop\n* Sound Effects in [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/)\n\nI constantly felt behind-schedule this Ludum Dare.  I think it's because I had to implement the mechanics for *two* basically unrelated games (although I feel they came together pretty well in the end, they're pretty independent - I've got a shooter with keyboard controls disabled and cards which simulate pressing keyboard controls ^_^).  It mostly all came together in the end, though I was really lacking on time to polish the art, I only spent about 3 hours on sound and art and all the rest was systems implementation -_-.\n\nI, of course, started with some programmer art of really hastily drawn ships in just a couple colors.  When it came time to make the final sprites, and there was only 2 hours left in the competition, I decided I didn't have time to re-make all of them well, so I simply scaled my 32x32 programmer sprites down to 13x13 sprites, and the dithering and blending really made them come alive!  Fix a couple stray pixels, and I have my final sprites, I think I only had to re-do one of them, because it just looked like a stupid face when scaled down ^_^.  Wish I had spent time on the cards instead of just using my UI system's generic \"panel\" border though!\n\nAlso, if you're read this far, check out my [other game on Steam](store.steampowered.com/app/467810/Splody/)!",

It combines lite bullet hell and caressing sim!\n\n\n![screen.png](///raw/5ba/3/z/1081e.png)\n\n\n\n\nThis is my 4th LD, and first time compo. I have always participated alone, but for some reason never got enough time to finish till the compo ends. But not this time! This is the reason there is no music tho, I have no idea how to do THAT. Whenever I open FL studio I feel like I'm in a dark cave: there is something there, breathing in the dark, but I can't tell what it is and better get out before it bit me.\n\nPixel art here is mediocre at best: I've been procrastinating and thinking too much over that one thing in Gamemaker that just couldn't work how I wanted. Other thing is the amount of content: the game is really short once you get ahold of controls. Speaking of controls, mouse can feel a bit weird at first: try moving it slowly, the player's speed is capped so that you can't racecar to the other side of the screen with your over 9k dpi razor mouse (not sponsored). One thing I wasn't sure of is 2 hp: is it too much or too small? Hmm...\n\nOriginally I was thinking about adding several different animals to be choosed randomly from, but ended up adding only a cat. Maybe or maybe not I'll add something else post-compo.\n\nAll things aside, I'd say the game turned out pretty ok. Thanks for reading this post (or skipping to the end of it) and (presumably) playing my game!",

In the beginning you have 10 blobs of each color. Use your mouse wheel to cycle through your colors.\n\nAim at uncolored blocks and press LMB to color them. Press RMB on colored blocks to make them transparent so you can see (kinda) what's behind them.\n\nWhenever you color a block, you lose one blob of color. You gain new blobs by connecting blocks of the same color. \n\nIf you connect at least 3 blocks (ie. their faces touch) they will vanish and you get one blob of color per block destroyed. Your score will also increase depending on how many blocks you destroyed (the more you destroy at once, the better).\n\nYou lose the game if you have no more color blobs left, or if you fall out of the big cube of cubes you're in.\n\nThere is no win condition. The point of the game is just to relax and raise your personal highscore. :)\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nNotes\n=====\n\no Generating the world may take a few moments so please be patient.\n\no As for the builds below, I was only able to test the Windows builds. For OSX and Linux, I just trusted Godot's exporter. Judging from comments so far, they seem to work fine though. :) \n\no The HTML5 build did not work at all.

They are produced by blocks.\n- Note that blocks cost resources when producing them! Lack of 'ingredients' makes blocks stop producing.\n\nHave fun!\n\n**Pattern formulas are at the end of the thread. Check them out if you have no clue of how to make higher level blocks**\n\n---\n\n### POST SUBMISSION UPDATES\n#### UPDATE 2.5 HOTFIX *on 4/24/2018 0:14*\nA quick fix of the block placement system. The camera's pitching angle is increased to 90 degrees top-down. Every cell is visible so there is no need for any 'mouse ray penetration'.\n\nThe drag \u0026 drop feel should be much nicer now, hopefully.\n\n#### UPDATE 2 *on 4/23/2018 19:38*\n- As I realized that most people would like to learn with the in-game process, I extented the tutorial a little bit. \n  I hope that makes the gameplay more understandable.\n- I got feedback that it's kinda difficult to drop blocks on desired positions, as the game track mouse position as `ground position`(i.e. where the pointer projects on the ground along the camera direction), rather than the piled up blocks. So some extra codes are added to make the drop \u0026 drop easier:\n - When pointing to the lower half of a pile with 2 or more blocks, or to a 0-or-1-block pile, mouse position is projected as `GROUND POSITION` (same as before)\n - When pointing to the upper half of a pile with 2 or more blocks, blocks are placed at the pile's top.\n\n#### UPDATE 1 *on 4/23/2018 14:16*\n- Reduced the lightmap size on MAC\n- Fixed the 'BIG ROUND CIRCLE SHADOW' problem on MAC\n- Fixed the issue that 'block stacks' may not update merging status when stacks around are merged.\n- Fixed the issue that sometimes the terrain and grids cannot be loaded properly\n\n### Available Patterns\n\nBlocks: \n- A = the wooden shelter with stone grinder\n- B = 2-story pig pen\n- C = purple-wall block with green roof\n- D = tallest red-wall block with golden roof\n\nPatterns below is from a top-down perspective. Multipliers means the number of certain blocks in stack.\n\nTo make B:\n```\nA*3\n```\n\nTo make C (all blocks must on the ground)\n```\nB-B-B\n\nOr\n\nB\nB\nB\n```\n\nTo make D (all blocks must on the ground)\n```\n  C\nC-C-C\n  C\n```\n\n*There are quicker ways to make C and D.

You play as the quarterback of the blue team. There are 4 levels for the 4 quarters in football. If you carry the ball into the end zone you get a touchdown worth 7 points and if you throw it in you get a field goal worth 3. If you get within the line of sight of one of the defenders on the red team they will dash at you, intercept the ball, and score a touchdown for their team. To counter this you can attempt to stay out of their line of sight or throw the football at them to stun them. At the end of the 4 quarters, the team with the most points wins.

An evil villain has started robotically controlling food, giving them sentience, and making them attack harmless citizens. Your job is to fight back against the waves of evil food, to get to, and destroy, the evil Cubidian. Your journey will be tough, but as the mayor of this city, I believe in you.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nMove: Click in the green circle to move.\n\nAttack: Once you move a red circle appears, click enemies inside of it to hit them and damage them.\n\nSkip Action: To skip any action like moving or attack press SPACE, you can also press skip in the bottom right of your screen.\n\nSwitch Weapons: You can switch weapons with 1 or 2, you can also switch them by clicking in the bottom middle of your screen, switching weapons will change attack range.\n\nLives: Your lives are in the bottom left corner of the screen, spend them wisely.\n\n\nThis is a Genre combination of Turned Based Strategy, Real Time Strategy, Horde Shoot-em-up.\n\n\n(Players Guide)\n\nHere is a guide for all of the players who are having trouble on any particular level of Burger Flipper.\n\nLevel 1) to avoid the burgers think smart about where you move. Your burger flipper can also one shot kill them, but at the price of some of your hp.\n\nLevel 2) Keep your eye out for that slow shooting Burger Shooter. He may not appear as a threat at first, but if you are not careful he can slowly rack up damage.\n\nLevel 3) A 1v1 duel with a Darth Tater can be tough. He shoots deadly lasers at you which may be tough to dodge. What you need to know is stay away from the melee attack. It does two damage! It would be better to run far away from him and get hit by a laser than to be hit by a melee attack.\n\nLevel 4) 2 Darth Taters is really tough, you want to take out the melee one first. He is the one closest to you. Then go after the guy in the bottom left corner of the screen. He moves slower but fires faster. He also only does 1 hearts worth of damage.\n\nLevel 5) A super Darth Tater can be really tough, luckily you can move extra fast for this level. I recommend stay far away from him moving in a methodical circle around him staying at the edge of his movement. He is hard though if you work hard to avoid his lasers, and get in the pattern of the fight you can beat him.\n\nThat will be the end of this guide. There are still more levels beyond Super Darth Tater, but I believe with the knowledge gained from the beginning fights you can tackle anything.",

      "Body": "![It's Dangerous to Roll Alone.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/10f64.png)\n\nOk, so I think I managed to hit the theme at least 2 ways. First, this is a game where you roll around as a marble, but you collect swords and shields, bash your enemies, gain XP, level up, and cast abilities like an RPG. Second, this is a game about collecting pets/monsters, but the monsters have an insane, procedurally-generated variety, which would make the task impossible if there weren't an element of a clicker game thrown in.\n\nThe monsters to be collected in this game are based on identicons, small symmetrical images generated from hashcodes. I call them Identimon. The color of the identimon represents its type, and its power, toughness, and health stats are generated by looking at the patterns within the generated identicon. Overall fill determines health. Pixels in the image with few neighbors contributes to power, and the opposite, pixels with many neighbors, contributes to defense.\n\nWhile investigating (defeating) each of the 4.2 billion species of Identimon, you can capture one to steal its special ability. Death ray, Lava Ball, and Dash are my favorites. You can also collect swords, shields, and speed potions from fallen foes to increase your own talents.\n\n![Lava Ball.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/10f73.png)\n\nIdentimon showing green names are lower level than you, yellow names mean a comparable level, and red names mean higher level. As you level up, you will be able to take on Identimon further from your base of operations, the Identimon Research Center. As you venture out further, you will find gold bars, which will allow you to start funding others to research the Identimon problem as well, contributing an increasing number of Identimon per Second (IPS) toward your progress (the clicker aspect).\n\n![Death Ray.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/10f7c.png)\n\nLegends talk of a fabled \"mound of riches\", where high-level Money type Identimon that drop gold bars abound. Maybe there, you can find enough funding to research them all!\n\nA small note about language:\nThe names of the Identimon are randomly generated. During development, I did observe one instance where an inappropriate name was generated, but it is very rare and as such I didn't feel the need to use compo time to police the random number generator.\n\nInstructions:\n- W/S - roll forward/backward\n- A/D - turn left right\n- no strafe or camera control, sorry (no time left).\n- C - Use right before delivering the killing blow to Capture an Identimon instead. You can only have one Identimon captured at a time.\n- F - Use the ability of the captured Identimon.\n- Alt-F4 - Quit game\n\nAbilities (Type):\n- Basic Shot (None) - Weak to middling slow missile attack. Get from any identimon up to level 5 that doesn't have a different attack.\n- Quick Shot (None) - Weak fast missile attack with low cooldown time. Get from any Identimon greater than level 5 that doesn't have a different attack.\n- War Cry (War) - Medium strength attack that hits all foes in a short-range cone in front of you. Get from any War type.\n- Death Ray (Death) - Medium+ strength attack that instantly hits all foes in a straight line in front of you. Get from Death types level 5 or higher.\n- Sea Spray (Ocean) - Medium- strength attack that hits all foes in a medium-range cone in front of you. Get from ocean types.\n- Lava Ball (Lava) - Strong attack that launches a ball of Lava at foes in front of you. The lava ball continues to roll around for a while, sometimes hitting enemies multiple times. Get from Lava types level 5 or higher.\n- Dash (None) - Thrust forward, hitting enemies extra hard for extra damage. Get from Sky or Time types.\n- Heal (None) - Heals one third of your HP, rounded down. Get from Life types.\n\nOther Tips:\n- Some Identimon are hostile and will attack when you come within range. Others are defensive and will ignore you unless damaged. War types are always hostile. Peace types are always defensive. Demon, Lava, and Death types have a 75% chance of being hostile. Thought, Flower, and Life types have a 25% chance of being hostile. All others have a 50% chance of being hostile.\n- Other Identimon will only join a fight if hostile or damaged.\n- Being largely ranged attackers, in a fight, Identimon will seek to establish range and use their abilities.\n",

      "Body": "(TL;DR: The pretty pictures and download links are below. Scroll down.)\n\n# DragTypist\nWhen I say DragTypist, I don't mean someone in the office is stepping out a bit with their fashion choices, although I'm not _not_ saying that, either...\n\nErr, anyway, this is a typing racing game. Because I've always bemoaned the lack of a keyboard behind the wheel. Press each letter as it appears in that cute little box above the track to move. That might sound easy (and it starts off pretty easy, but like most predators, I'm here to lull you into a false sense of security), but the faster you go, the harder it gets. Just like real driving, right? (I wouldn't know, I _always_ follow the speed limit). But seriously, as you go faster, the letters get harder to reach **and** you have less time to press them. Oh wait, I didn't tell you have to press them before they time out? See, I already trapped you!\n\nAlso, there's this other thing where if you go too fast for too long, your engine will blow up. Don't worry, it's not serious, you'll just stop completely. But you can go again right away, so it's not too bad. If you need to cool down, just miss a couple of letters (press the wrong one or let them time out, I don't really mind). Or just to make things interesting, press a lot of them in a row without missing any and you'll get a cooldown bonus!\n\nMuch as I'd love to crowd around a keyboard with a friend or two, multiplayer isn't something I had time for. There's \"AI\" cars though. They're not very smart, but they don't need to be. They only have to go in a straight line. A better way to compete would be for the quickest time. Actually, speaking of that,\n## Please share your times in the comments!\n\n**Some people have said that it's a bit too hard, so I made an easier version, but remember _that is not the compo version, play that one (the download link is at the bottom of this post, before the comments), and score it_ then if you want to try the easy version, the download link is in the comments.**\n\nAlternatively, I don't know if anybody thought it was too easy, but I made a hard version. The download link for that is in another comment further down, but for the sake of my reviews, please remember to *play and score the regular version first*.\n\n## How to Run\nWindows: extract the zip and run dragtypist.exe.\n\nLinux (Thanks to @mrspeaker in the comments): If you have Python 3 already installed (most distributions should, if running `python3 --version` doesn't give you an error, you should be alright (I've only tested with 3.6 so I don't know how well earlier versions will run), if not, consult your distribution's documentation for how to install it), install pygame with `pip3 install pygame`, then extract the source code zip into a folder, open a terminal in that folder and run `python3 ./dragtypist.py`\n\nOther platforms: download the source code, extract it somewhere and run dragtypist.py in Python. You'll need Python 3 and pygame (which you should be able to install through pip). If I have time later, I'll see if I can provide a precompiled version for Linux (ironically the platform least likely to need one).\n\n## Controls\nPress **the letter** that's in the box. It's that simple!\n\nWell, except for pause. Press **escape** to do that.\n\n## Developed in:\nPython, using Pygame. Sound effects generated using Bfxr, musical cacophonies made in Bosca Ceoil. \n\n## System Requirements\n- Not much, really. Haven't formally tested it, but it's worked fine on the two systems I've tried it on. Anything that supports SDL, I guess, but it only uses software rendering, so I don't see why anything couldn't run it. Please don't take this as a challenge.\n- A 640x480 minimum screen resolution. It'll probably run at less than that, but you won't be able to see all of it. Which would be bad. But as an added bonus, if your desktop resolution is at least 1280 x 960, it'll run at that.\n - One **actual** note here: it only takes screen resolution into account, not scaling. This can both be a good thing (set scaling in Windows to whatever you want it to and it'll follow that) and a bad thing (it can go off screen if game resolution x scaling is above your actual resolution).\n- Software requirements:\n - Windows: A relatively modern version of Windows. Not sure if XP would work. 8.1-10 probably have all they need already. 7 may or may not need the Visual C++ Redistributable available from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads.\n - Other platforms: Python 3.6 and Pygame 1.9.3. Not sure how well earlier/newer versions would work. Hopefully well.\n\n## Any problems?\nHit me up (preferably not literally) in the comments section - I'll be keeping an eye out!\n\n![1.png](///raw/414/7/z/10c84.png)\n\n![2.png](///raw/414/7/z/10c85.png)\n\n![3.png](///raw/414/7/z/10c88.png)\n\n![4.png](///raw/414/7/z/10c89.png)\n\n![5.png](///raw/414/7/z/10c8b.png)",

They were huge before and I forgot to fix them. While this will make enemies harder to hit, they're still pretty big so it shouldn't be a problem. The biggest problem this solves is trying to shoot around dead monsters and hitting them instead.\n* Player and enemy bullets now hit walls. This prevents enemies from shooting you through walls (duh). It's also just kinda cool.\n* Made the last two waves' recipes easier and increased the chances of Dog-O's appearing in the last wave. It was way too hard before.\n\nNote that the player can still move through walls. This is a quirk of the movement code that I didn't figure out until too late. IMO it's too major of a change to make as part of a small LD update.\n\nOnce LD voting is over, I'll fix the wall collision and perhaps update the level layout a bit. And who knows? Maybe I'll make it into a more complete game.",

It was tested using Chrome; I recommend using Chrome to play ¬∂City unless you're sure of your browser's full support of ES6 functionality.\n\nThe game hasn't got music or sounds of its own, but I recommend putting on a playlist in the background such as [this one](https://goo.gl/ovbQ8b) while you build and explore...\n\n### [**Click here to play ¬∂City**](http://pineapplemachine.com/files/ld41/release1/index.html)\n\n# Background\n\nI was considering ways to interpret the theme and, as soon as I hit on the idea of a text-based RPG/city-building sim hybrid, I knew I had something with potential. I've been writing text RPG games for as long as I've been writing code at all; I even made one for [LD16](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview\u0026uid=1540)! But I've come a long way as a game developer since then, and I think I've done a lot better this time.\n\n¬∂City is pronounced as _Pilcrow City_, _Paragraph City_ or, if you're not feeling up to all those syllables, _P-City_. The game mechanics are inspired primarily by [Simcity 3 and 4](https://goo.gl/xDKEjz), both of which I spent silly amounts of time playing when I was a kid. Meanwhile the fantasy environment and narrative tone take a lot from the Discworld series, which I happen to be reading through recently...\n\n# Game mechanics\n\nWith all the time I saved by not making graphics, I was able to add a lot of content to ¬∂City ‚Äî more than 8,000 words of text worth.\n\nThere are roughly thirty different types of buildings in the game, and all of them will have different effects on your city. Many of them also help you to develop and navigate the city in unique ways. (For example, at the Senate and at Courthouses you can speak with an NPC to learn about the city's population, housing, and employment statistics, and you can also approve construction offers at a bulletin board.) A lot of information about different kinds of buildings can be gleaned by reading in-game help topics, but the only way to really understand the effects a building has on your city is to go ahead and have it built! ¬∂City is meant to be a game of exploration, in which by experimentation you can gradually gain a better understanding of your city and and how its different pieces interact.\n\nBeing a game partly about exploration of its mechanics, ¬∂City can be a bit opaque sometimes. **If you're having trouble, you can [read the tutorial here](http://pineapplemachine.com/files/ld41/release1/tutorial.html).** But don't resort to the tutorial for help unless you're really lost; much of the fun of playing ¬∂City is discovering its mechanics and interactions on your own!\n\nNote that your game progress is saved to your browser's local storage. This means that if you close the tab and come back to the game later, you'll be able to pick up from where you left off.\n\n# Miscellaneous data\n\n- **Time spent actively developing ¬∂City:** About 30 hours\n- **Tools used:** Chrome and Sublime Text 3\n- **Code written:** 6,080 lines\n- **Amount of unique in-game text:** 8,622 words\n- **Most-used non-stopwords:** *people* (35), *city* (33), *residents* (33), *food* (28), and *place* (27)\n- **Number of distinct colors:** 90 hexcodes\n- **Most frustrating moment:** Adding interiors to player-constructed buildings\n- **Most satisfying moment:** Adding Her Royal Highness as an NPC\n- **Tea/coffee consumed:** Two cups of decaf Earl Gray\n\n# Post-deadline changes\n\n- *2018-04-23 15:40 UTC: Fixed an issue that was preventing a very important piece of help text from appearing when the player enters \"wait\".*\n- *2018-04-23 18:20 UTC: Fixed an issue that could sometimes occur when talking to a barkeep.*\n- *2018-04-26 17:50 UTC: Fixed an issue involving Galleries erroneously believing that they were Smithys.*\n- *2018-04-27 18:50 UTC: Fixed an issue where certain building types were impossible not to overtax.*\n- *2018-04-27 19:00 UTC: Fixed an issue with the conditions under which a building's \"marked for demolition\" text was displayed.*\n",

Game is missing one of the most important features - Working power-ups. You can still place them, but they're not even coded to do anything. The game was intended to be much bigger than it is now, but I encountered many, many unexpected problems and had to cut half of the game. Originally, you had only 5 cards in the first turn. You could get another 2 in next 2 turns. I also planned more cards, including ones affecting the enemy's deck.\n\nI consider this game as my personal failure. I'm gonna add stuff like sounds and menu options later, some time after the jam, but right now I'm exhausted. That's my first LD game I'm not proud of. However, it's still playable, so if you just wanna race, grab a friend and have fun.\n\nMy nickname in the title is to avoid duplicating other games, if someone had the same idea. It's not because of my ego. :)",

Since the characters are so small the effect is not visible like I aimed.\n\nI made the background music during the event using GarageBand.

Welcome to this awesome game!\n\nTo make this game I used the genere of reviewing games on the Ludum Dare Web page, and the board game one. \n\n\nTo play this game you will need:\n\n**1.** **Find an oponent** (or multiple opponents!) and consider yourself penguins that want to grab fishes for the winter.\n\n**2.** Each player/penguin has to **pick a rating theme**:\n ( Innovation, Fun, Theme, Graphics ... )\n\n**3.** By turns, each player will **pick one of the puddles** of the image, and **roll a dice**.\nIf the number of the dice on the table below the puddle has a **fish**, add a star on the characteristic you picked (innovation, fun ...). (double for the one that has two fishes).\n\n**4.** If the number is a **skull**, one of the sharks of the puddle will eat you and you will have to represent another penguin (so move all the stars of the counter back to **0**).\n\n**5**. The first to reach the **5 stars(fishes) will win!** (now you can play again, or not play evermore).\n\n**6. Extra**: if you don't have so many friends, you can play with **multiple rating characteristics** each, increasing the amount of fishes/stars needed. \n\n**7.** You can also **play by yourself** with different penguins, and pretend that you have friends on the comment. (As you may have noticed this is a solo project for the compo, so no shame **\u003c3** )\n\n**8.** You have to have **fun!** (I like adding this condition, because this way if you are not having fun is only because you are not following the rules \u003c3\u003c3\u003c3\u003c3\u003c3 )\n\n\n\n![boardPenguinSharks.png](///raw/53b/51/z/10553.png)\n\n\n\nTo roll the dice, you can use this gif I made for you : ) \n(to roll, click it with the mouse and drag the image, and a frozen frame of the dice will be your rolled number : ) on mobile you can screenshot or whatever ) (Just realized that this mechanic does not work on Chrome, you shall use https://www.random.org/dice/?num=1): (\n![dice.gif](///raw/53b/51/z/10564.gif)\n\nBe happy, have fun and leave comments! : D\n\n\n",

You play as a team of souls imprisoned in hell and forced by demons to play a game with severed heads.\n\nAt the start of the game, the head demon randomly picks a player from one team and decapitates them. Their head becomes the ball.\n\nTo score, pass the head to another player through the enemy team's hoop. So one player has to be directly north of the hoop and the other one south, or vice versa. Then pass the head to the other player to score.\n\nIf the head is on the ground, you can pick it up by moving onto it. A player in possession on the head may not move and only pass it to another player. Position your players near the throwing or receiving enemy players to have a chance to intercept the head. You can also tackle enemy players, pushing them and causing them to drop the head.\n\nThe head, through severed, is still conscious and can also participate. The team whose head it is can use it to bite enemy players holding it, or emit a horrible scream that weakens all adjacent players.\n\nThe demons slowly narrow the play field by advancing on it from the top and bottom. Any player caught by demons is decapitated, their head becoming the new ball. Play ends when the demons overrun the field, and the winning team is the one with more points.\n\nMade in one day for Ludum Dare 41 Compo. Font is \"Flailed\" by Eeve Somepx.",

You need to defend from within the safety of your walls. Throw spells at the enemies to annihilate them.\n\nI did want to get audio in but couldn't find the time. I instead aimed for a more polished, well-rounded game with a main menu/controls and victory/defeat screens. I also wanted to explore the depth of cards a lot more, there's a lot of extend-ability and exploration to be done with different cards, however I was only able to get 9 cards in.\n\nOverall I'm pretty happy with what I produced in two days. This was my first ludum dare after wanting to join for years, I finally got round to it!\n\nKnown Bugs:\nThere's a visual glitch on spells sometimes where its particle effect is still ongoing after drawing it.

Avoid bankruptcy. Plan well.\n\nSelect an action. Then start doing. Bounce ball on paddle. Harvest beet to sell. Grab beet to harvest. Tip: Water field before planting.\n\nThis game requires you to multitask. Think of a task as a ball you're  juggling on the paddle. You can juggle up to 3 balls in this game, so you can carry out up to 3 tasks at a time.\n\n[W] [S] to select [A] [D] to move [SPACE] to launch [ESC] for menu.\n\nIt's a farm sim + Pong/Breakout mashup.\n\n3 actions to select from: (1) WATER, (2) HAND with SEED (to plant a seed), (3) HAND (to harvest a beet).\n\nAfter an action is selected, launch the \"ball\" and start farming. \n\nYou can only do up to 3 actions at a time (3 \"balls\" to juggle at a time).\n\nDecide which 3 actions are you going to do at any time. \n\nDrop off an action (literally, drop off the ball) that you don't need to make space for an action that you do need.\n\nWater costs money. Planting a seed costs money and makes you hungry. Harvesting a beet makes you hungry.\n\nUsing a hand with seed to plant a seed, once the seed is planted, it will turn into just a hand for harvesting a beet.\n\nSo if you want to harvest a fully grown beet, instead of using just a hand, you can launch a hand with seed to plant a seed, then it'll turn into just a hand that can pick up the grown beet too. Doing this saves you a little from hunger.\n\nYou need to water your seeds so that they'll grow. They'll also wilt if they lose all their moisture.\n\nTiles too, dry up gradually, and moisture can be maintained in the tiles by constantly watering them.\n\nTiles with plants on them dry up faster then tiles without.\n\nWhen your beet are fully grown, you can harvest them.\n\nJuggling a harvested beet to the bowl at the bottom left corner would fill your hunger. \n\nJuggling it to the shipment box at the bottom right corner would sell it for money.\n\nYou also have to pay your ever increasing tax dues every 30 in-game months (seconds in real life).\n\n",

Those are two genres that you definitely don't see very often, so I decided it would be perfect for the theme. This one might actually be fun, it even says so in the title.\n\nIn this game, you must raise money for your brother, who's escaped the authoritarian nation you're in, but was shot while doing so, so needs you to pay for a life-saving operation that he needs to survive. You have a job, but you are paid very little, certainly not as much as you need. You must therefore turn to the black market, buying low and selling high at night, all while avoiding the police that patrol to enforce the curfew. \n\nFeatures:\n- Pac-Man-esque map and movement\n- Multiple-agent enemy AI\n- Trading simulation\n- Fully simulated market, prices fluctuate; it's possible cookies can cost more than a TV\n- Non-intrusive but detailed story (at least at the start and end of the game)\n- Different endings\n- Fully implemented legal system (totalitarian legal system, it's either prison or death, but still)\n- Walls! Unlike some of my previous games, you no longer need to pretend they're there\n\nMissing:\n- Audio. And I was so sure I would have enough time this time around, but nope! Maybe one of these LDs I'll finally add music.\n\nThanks for playing!\nNow it's time for sleep.",

I would have asked for a license to include the tune but figured they would laugh at my art. I decided it wasn't worth the trouble. Instead, I've given you the first line of the song and you can sing the parts you know.\n\n\"Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law...(3 lines skipped)... Hangman is comin' down from the gallows and I don't have very long\" - from \"Renegade\" by Styx on the album Pieces of Eight, circa 1979\n\nThe game is not fully balanced :( and the dictionary of words is kind of short. Opinions differed on whether full health should be restored after a word is successfully guessed. High score is not currently saved, and it's really hard to get past Level 1. It would probably be a lot easier if I had actually had time to build a Level 2. No theme song -- no audio at all, actually, but this way you won't get in trouble if you play it at work, right? Hands on the keyboard but only the space bar does anything. Well, except maybe for one key that I forgot to take out of the debug build. Oops! Easter egg?\n\nThis game was created using the free-for-the-weekend GameMaker Studio 2 which I started learning on Friday night. :D I thought I'd be able to output HTML but no luck.

Please help us!\"_\n___\nSkaart comes to the rescue and is armed with the Slot Gun, a gun capable of inflicting devastating blows... only if you manage to get the lucky hit. His weapon is useful, but sometimes hurts more than it helps.\n___\n\n### GAMEPLAY\nYour goal is to go through the forest while using your Slot Gun to kill the haunted trees. \nThe catch is that the gun's bullets are tied to a slot machine, so you have to shoot at the right time to have the appropriate effect. Remember, the Slot Gun is helpful... but it may also be harmful!\n___\n### CONTROLS\n* WASD - movement \n\n* W - jump \n\n* K - start the slot \n\n* K _(while in slot mode)_ - shoot \n\n* J _(while in slot mode)_ - cancel the slot \n\n* R - restart\n\n* ALT + ENTER - fullscreen\n\n____\n\n### TOOLS USED\n\n* Game Maker Studio 2\n\n* Aseprite _(pixel art)_\n\n* Audacity, Bfxr.net _(sound effects)_\n\n* Beepbox.co _(soundtrack)_\n\n____\n\n### OUT OF TIME\n\nOh I wish I had just a bit more time! I spent most of the jam setting a base to the mechanics and elements of the game, but as the clock was ticking, I was unable to apply it. I had several other bullet (or _Slotties_ ) effects idea. _(such as a healing bullet, melee bullets, crazy but dumb effects - like transforming the enemy into a frog)_ Adding a bit more enemies wouldn't have been bad neither... and obviously, more content. I made all the (playable) rooms in the last couple of hours.\n____\n### PERSONAL NOTE\n\nI hope you will (or did) enjoy your experience with **Skaart**, although it's not very finished. It was really fun an satisfying to make (especially the art and sound effects). It's my second entry for Ludum Dare! My first was way back, after one of my first game jams. It's also my first time participating in the **Compo**! My scope was a bit too big, but I'm still happy on how many things I squeezed in in 48 hours. :)\n\n**I hope you like my new baby. ‚ô•**\n___\n",

As a survivor of the recent apocalypse you seek to take back and settle the city of Kasprzak. You win the game if you can settle 30 a total of 30 survivors. You lose if everyone in your group dies.\n\nI haven't had much time to see if the game is balanced okay or not. This game may be quite difficult or quite easy. I'm hoping somewhere in the middle.\n\nWritten in C# MonoGame. \n\n## Issues/Changelog\n\n**NOTE POST-COMPO-CHANGE**: I did tweak things just a little bit so that ammo would drop more because it wasn't dropping enough to warrant needing 3 to upgrade a fighter. In retrospect you get enough food every time that the medical cards are basically useless :P Please rate keeping in mind the original build was a bit more difficult.\n\n**0 and 8 look too similar in the font** I shouldn't have included the dot in the middle.\n\n## Controls\n\nUse the Arrow Keys and Enter Button\n\n## Gameplay\n\nEvery turn as 2 to 3 phases.\n\n### Movement Phase\n\nIn phase 1 you move your group. The outskirts are rural, that moves to suburban and urban as you move to the center. Rural tiles are lower risk and take 3 survivors to settle. Urban tiles are the most risky but will settle 9 survivors. Once you settle a tile you may move through it freely. Otherwise every tile change triggers the next phase...\n\n### Action Phase\n\nIn this phase you face a situation. You can respond by fighting, looting and running, or just running. Each action has risk of consequences\n\n![Capture2.PNG](///raw/d01/z/b191.png)\n\n#### Fighting\n\nThis is the most risky action and always carries the chance of a death to the group. If you fight you will always receive the scouted resource cards. Fighting is the only way to make it to the 3rd phase.\n\n#### Looting \u0026 Running\n\nIn this action you will get at least 1 of the resource cards, at random. This carries the same risks as running, but carries with it an additional risk. \n\n#### Running\n\nIn this action there is risk, but no reward outcome. Usually, the risk will be less than fighting. **With both running, and looting and running,*** you will lose 1 wellness point and immediately go back to the Movement Phase.\n\n#### Resource Cards\n\nEvery Action Phase will have a number of scouted resource cards. These are the resources you'll get if you fight or may get if you loot \u0026 run. Resource cards are used to buy things in the Resting phase.\n\n#### Risks \u0026 Consequences\n\nEvery action has associated risks with known consequences. There are 3 consequences:\n\n* Death: Someone in your group will die\n* Injury: You will lose an additional wellness point\n* Damage: You will lose resource cards\n\n### Resting Phase\n\nIf you Fight you'll enter the Resting Phase. In this phase you can use the resource cards you have gathered. You can restore wellness points. You can upgrade one of your group to a fighter. Or you can settle the tile you are on.\n\n![Capture3.PNG](///raw/d01/z/b220.png)\n\n#### Wellness Points\n\nWellness points are a hunger clock of sorts. You need to keep your wellness points above 0. If you do not keep them above zero then members of your group will desert your group 1 per turn until your group is no more. use Food and Medical cards to increase these during the Resting Phase. Running diminishes your wellness points through attrition.\n\n##### Fighters\n\nTo settle a tile (see below) you will need a special class of survivor called a fighter. These are indicated by the use of green. To add additional fighters you need to collect a weapon card and 3 ammo cards.\n\n##### Settling A Tile\n\nSettling tiles requires you to have enough members of your group to settle the tile, including the required number of fighters, building materials, and food. The cost of settling is dependent on your map location. Rural has less cost, urban has more, suburban is in the middle. When you settle a tile, the members of your group leave.\n\nWhen you are done with the resting phase you may return to the Movement phase.\n\n### Game Ends When...\n\nThe game will end if you either complete the mission of settling 30 of your group, or if everyone dies or deserts the group.\n\n## A note on theme usage\n\nThe original design for this game called for other factions to attack your settlements (the more you have). Due to time constraints I opted instead for the size of your group to adjust difficulties. It will be more costly for you to run or loot and run when you have a large group. However, it becomes less risky to fight. I wish I had more time to incorporate the theme better.\n\n# THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!\n",

Instead of rating this game, try rating [some other game](https://ldjam.com/games/smart/all) that doesn't yet have enough to be ranked. Thanks!**\n\nDefense 2150 BC is a tower-defense game with the added twist that, if an enemy destroys one of your towers, they steal the abilities from it.\n\n## Instructions\nControls:\n  Move Camera: WASD\n  Place / Destroy towers: Left click\n  Scroll through towers: Scroll wheel\n\nTowers can only be placed next to already-existing towers. You are awarded money with which to purchase towers every time you kill and enemy and at the end of each wave. There are 34 waves to beat to win; I have no idea if this is doable.\n\nThere are 5 tower types:\n- Shield: High health, does no damage.\n- Bow: Shoots piercing, low-damage projectiles.\n- Cannon: Shoots high-splash-damage projectiles.\n- Smasher: Smashes enemies that walk inside it; some art smart enough to avoid it.\n- Spear Trap: Damages enemies above it; as such, it only is useful against flying enemies.\n\nThese instructions are also present in an in-game help menu.\n\n## Credits\nAs this is a compo game, I am obviously responsible for all the game logic / art / music.\n\nThis game is built using two libraries, as a result of [shoehorning one in](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/$49963/sound-question-mark) during the competition. The two libraries in question are [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).\n\nThe font used on the Help, Win, and Lose screens is [Laconick-NormalA](http://www.1001fonts.com/laconick-normala-font.html) by Nick Curtis.\n\n## Versions\nI'm pretty sure that the Windows version works. (I tested it by clearing out my PATH and copying DLLs until it ran successfully). If it doesn't work, please say so.\n\n~~I should be uploading a Linux build soon.~~ (Probably not going to happen).\n\nI probably won't upload a Mac build unless I can find a way to build for Mac on Linux / Windows.\n\n## Other\nNote that this game is built using a few custom tools and libraries, including both [jot](https://github.com/rdynamics/jot), which unceremoniously shoves images into a C file, so that they are \"packed\" into an executable, and [zgcl](https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/zgcl), which is a C library that halfheartedly implements a generic `std::vector`-like interface.",

You need to stop this and catch him. But try not upset the people too much. Remember: The tighter you squeeze, the more they will slip through your fingers. The more troops you raise and more tax you raise to support securing your power, the worse your rebel problem will become.\n\n## Gameplay instructions\n\n1. Send spies to villages to track down rebel/hero activity. To do so, click the village on the map and adjust the target spies.\n2. After a short while you will get a status report. If you find the hero, send soldiers to kill him. It will take 5 soldiers to subdue him.\n3. To recruit more soldiers/spies, go to your castle and click the button. Soldiers cost 20 gold, and spies cost 40 gold.\n4. If you run out of gold, you can tax the people to get more gold. Be warned, that upsets the taxed village (a lot!) and also raises the global unrest slightly.\n\n## Controls\n\n* Arrow keys to move around the map\n* Click on the castle to recruit more troops/spies\n* Click on a village/castle to adjust the number of troops or spies stationed there.\n* Popups close when you move the map.\n\n## Tips\n\n* Tax rate is 0.3g per villager. Tax the highest pop villages for better effect!\n\n## Setup instructions\n\n### Windows\n\n1. Download the windows zip file.\n2. Unzip\n3. Run vizier.exe\n\n### Linux\n\n1. Install Python 3.6 (see your distro package manager. May require PPAs)\n2. [Install Kivy](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html)\n3. Download the repository dump.\n4. Run play-linux.sh\n\n### Mac\n\n1. Try the linux instructions, but not officially supported",

If you retract fast enough, you might just get away.\n\n**Important!**\n\nI know that often times when rating LD games people will only play for a minute or two, which I completely understand. I included a handy \"skip level button\" (P), and if you aren't going to play all the way through, here is my recommended level path that I think is the most fun/best represents the game:\n\n**Level 0** --\u003e **Level 1** --\u003e Level 4 --\u003e Level 5 --\u003e **Level 6** --\u003e Level 7 --\u003e **Level 9** --\u003e Level 10 --\u003e Level 14 --\u003e Level 16\n\nThe bolded levels introduce key concepts to you, so you probably want to play those!\n\n**Controls:**\n\nMove with WASD\nIncrease/Decrease Light Intensity with Mouse Scroll Wheel (or M and N respectively on a laptop)\n\n**Note:**\nMusic is off by default, as I felt it made the atmosphere more tense, but there is an option to turn it on.\n\nIf you're stuck on a particularly hard level, press P to skip it.\n\nYou may want to turn the sound down a little in the Volume Mixer, sounds are a little loud (especially the scream).\n\n**Resources Used:**\n- C++\n- SFML\n- Visual Studio 2017\n- Photoshop\n- Gimp (because my Photoshop license ran out mid-jam)\n- FL Studio\n- Audacity\n\nI usually make my Ludum Dare games with Unity, but this time I opted for C++ and SFML as a new challenge. I'm really happy with the amount of content I got packed in here while still programming my own collisions and lights and stuff like that.

Always recommending stupid ingredients, they should just do their own job and stop pestering you while you cook. You've got critics in tonight too, so don't muck it up!\n\n**GAMEPLAY:**\n\nCooks will periodically offer ingredients for your lovely broth. Each ingredient has qualities like: sweet, spice, salt, sour \u0026 savoury, that it will add (or take) from the dish. If you don't want the ingredient added though, you can slap 'em upside the head with your spatula by clicking the left mouse button. Your goal is to get a balance of each flavour. Aim to get as many flavour bars as possible within the golden markers \u0026 keep them there, to score. Bonuses for getting them right in the middle!\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nPepper (The red thing): ++Spice, +Sweet\n\nOnion (The stripy brown): +Spice, +Savoury\n\nChocolate (Mmmm, chocolate): ++Sweet, -Savoury\n\nChicken (Drumstick yeah): ++Savoury, +Salt\n\nFish (Good source of omega 3!): ++Salt, +Savoury\n\nPotato (The thing that looks like sick, drawing pixel potatoes is hard yo): -EVERYTHING BUT SAVOURY\n\nLime (It looks green and limey): ++Sour, -Savoury\n\nThese have other minor +'s \u0026 -'s too but I'll leave to ya'll to figure out!\n\n**OTHER INFO:**\n\nThis game was made using the Unity engine, SunVox (music) \u0026 Aseprite (graphics). The font used is pixellari by Zacchary Dempsey-Plante and can be found [here](http://zaccharydempseyplante.ca/customFont.php).\n\n![Screenshot3.png](///raw/d66/8/z/a49c.png)",

Hopefully I'll be motivated to complete it one day. \n\n#IMPORTANT\nYou can only switch personalities if the current personality doesn't have its ult on cooldown.\n\nAlso, My favorite ability is the Beam, press 4 then C to use it ^ - ^\n\nThe whole game is literally like 5-10 minutes of walking xd Kinda like my last times.\nI gotta remember to KISS next time. \n\nIn case you don't understand (You won't without this prob xd):\n\n######Personalities:\n-1: Empty: Ability: Fireball thingy; Ultimate: None\n\n-2: Choleric:  Ability: PhaseOrb Thingy; Ultimate: Uproar, Slam the ground knocking enemies away\n\n-3: Sanguine:  Ability: Dash (Not working); Ultimate: Final Breath, heal yourself\n\n-4: Phlegmatic: Ability: Light Stair, Put a block in front of you; Ultimate: Tranquil Timeender, Shoot a beam that decimates enemies.\n\n-5: its there but doesn't do aynthing xd\n\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\n-Playermodel randomly rotates sometimes.

My first experience with them was for a school project I finished a few days before the jam.\n\n![GooBallThumbnail.png](///raw/418/c/z/b6c5.png)\n\n*EDIT* : The game is a bit broken, when the timer is finished the game doesn't stop so there isn't any real time challenge. Also once on the finish screen pressing a key doesn't go laucnh a replay (you'll have to reload the web page). And finally once you've entered phase 3 there's no real interest in going back to the others which is a mechanic default that I didn't notice since I barely had time to test the game before. I could patch this real quick but I'm not sure if that is allowed or not. Anyway just to say I am aware of these bugs.\n\n*EDIT 2* : I have released a small patch that fixes most of the problems that shouldn't have existed if I had organized my time better and left more time to playtest and this is the game that will launch on the itch.io by default. The original game is still available, you just need to download it (it's a HTML game so no Anti-Virus related hassle, I'm looking at you Avast).",

It's called *Kids, Don't Do Wild Magic*, inspired by the Wild Magic subclass of Sorcerer in D\u0026D 5th edition.\n\n![SS1.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b071.jpg)\n\nYou are locked in a duel with another mage in an arena, and your job is to be the last one standing. Use your spells to lower their health to zero while maintaining yours by dodging their attacks! The trick is that you follow the school of Wild Magic, and the more you cast the crazier (and usually worse!) things get. But that doesn't concern you - where would be the fun without the bewildering arcane aberrations?\n\n## Controls\n**W** - Move forward\n\n**S** - Move backward\n\n**A** - Strafe left\n\n**D** - Strafe right\n\nHold **Right Mouse Button** + **Mouse move** - Horizontal camera control\n\nHold **Shift** + **Space** - Enter casting. Disables movement.\n\n### While Casting\nHold **W** - Flamethrower\n\nHold **S** - Throw fireball\n\n#### Once More!\nHold Shift + Space + W for the flamethrower.\n\nHold Shift + Space + S for fireballs.\n\n![SS3.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b076.jpg)\n\n## Wild Magic\nAs you cast more spells, your wild magic will go up. This will increase the range of your flamethrower and the explosion of you fireball, but can also come with side effects! Look for 11 unique effects to take place as you go about your battle.\n\n![SS2.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b078.jpg)\n\n## Your Opponent\nYour opponent is crafty ice mage. Watch out for their ice lances and ice meteors. They also have the ability to teleport - listen for the distinctive sound this spell makes.\n\nIf you're having trouble, remember these tips for good fire magin'\n- Stay evasive. Don't let yourself get hit by those lances and slow moving meteors.\n- Get close. Your flamethrower can be devastating, if only you can get close enough.\n- Use their avoidance. Your enemy will try to avoid you if possible. Use this to your advantage by backing them into explosions.\n- Charge up. Your attacks become much more effective once you've charged up your wild magic. You'll know you've reached your full power when the sky goes dark!\n\n![SS4.jpg](///raw/054/3/z/b0b9.jpg)",

      "Body": "![apocolypsecorptitle.png](///raw/697/1/z/b099.png)\n\nHello fellow game designers! This is my first submission to ludum dare, and I have to say I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out! The game is a tile-based building game where you try to gain as much money (or last as long) as possible. By expanding your mining network, you will gain more money to help you expand further. However, the machines you take advantage of also cause pollution, and this has very negative effects on the environment. This comes in the form of tornadoes that will come and destroy your mining network.\n\nSee how long you can last before the tornadoes destroy your empire!\n\n\n## About the Game\n\nApocalypse Corp was inspired by 2D tile-based builder games and the clicker mechanic from cookie clicker. By combining the two, I hoped to achieve a unique experience where you looked to improve click efficiency while also having to think strategically about building placement. The storms in the game were an extra addition that I hoped would fit nicely with the theme of the contest: the more you have the worse it gets. The announcement of this theme spawned the idea of having pollution as a byproduct of building that would make the experience more difficult.\n\n![apocolypsecorpgame.png](///raw/697/1/z/b0ee.png)\n\n\n## How to Play\n\nOn the title screen of the game, there is a quick slideshow of a tutorial that briefly explains concepts within the game. Here I'll go into a bit more detail. The purpose of the game is to last as long as possible, build the largest grid, make the most money, and/or get the highest pollution level you can before you succumb to the incoming onslaught of storms. Once you lose your central power plant, the game is over and you lose.\n\n### Buildings\n\n![PowerPlant.png](///raw/697/1/z/dc17.png)\nThe power plant is the most important structure in the game. You cannot build any more and if it gets destroyed you lose. You generate power for your grid by clicking the power plant. This sends a \"surge\" of power that allows for certain buildings to perform their given function.\n\n![Conduit.png](///raw/697/1/z/dc19.png)\nThe conduit is responsible for carrying power to any of your structures. ANY BUILDING MUST BE ADJACENT TO EITHER A CONDUIT OR THE POWER PLANT IN ORDER TO WORK! Choose carefully where these are positioned! Try not to block in your conduit network with buildings! You need to be able to expand your conduit network further out to power buildings that are farther away.\n\n![Miner.png](///raw/697/1/z/dc1d.png)\nThe miner is the way you make money (thus granting the ability to buy more structures) in this game. When this building receives a surge of power, you will make $1. It also produces pollution at the same time which will cause larger storms.\n\n![HeatLaser.png](///raw/697/1/z/dc1f.png)\nThe heat laser is your means of defense against the storm. A pulse from the power plant will \"charge\" the laser. A laser must have enough power charged up to fire at nearby storms. Each click generates 2 power (max 100) and each shot by a laser takes 20 power. The laser cooldown is 3 seconds.\n\n![Surger.png](///raw/697/1/z/dc24.png)\nThe last and most expensive structure is the surger. This will automatically pulse every 2 seconds as a way to automate your power grid.\n\n\n### Controls\n\n__**Buidling:**__\n\nSelect a building to build using the buttons on the UI or one of the hotkeys (see below)\nClick the space on the map where you want the building (you must have enough cash for this operation to succeed)\n\n__**Camera:**__\n\nYou can use your mouse's scroll wheel to zoom in and out.\n\nMoving your mouse to the edge of the screen will translate the camera laterally.\n\n__**HotKeys:**__\n\n[ 1 ] - select a conduit for building\n\n[ 2 ] - select a miner for building\n\n[ 3 ] - select a heat laser for building\n\n[ 4 ] - select a surger for building\n\n[ D ] - destroy the selected building (DO NOT CLICK THIS WITH THE POWER PLANT SELECTED OR YOU WILL LOSE)\n \n[ LEFTSHIFT ] - When building, holding left shift will let you place multiple of the selected building\n\n",

Killing these monsters will give you more gold. The more gold you have, the heavier you get so you walk slower, also more monsters will be attracted to you if you have more gold, making it more difficult. There are items to spend the gold on which both make you stronger and make you have less gold which means temporarily less monsters. You have two attacks, a stab and a slash with your sword. The slash dos a bit of damage and knocks monsters back, the stab does not knock back much but does a lot more damage.\n\n## CONTROLS:\n\nWASD to move.\nLeft click in the direction of the monster to stab.\nRight click in the direction to slash.\n\n## HINTS:\n\nuse the slash often as a defensive attack and then only the stab to finish because it will not knock them back enough to keep them away.\n\nwalk backwards away from monsters while attacking them to give them less chance to hit you\n",

      "Body": "Created from scratch in 48 hours for my first Ludum Dare!\n\nUpdate: I've made some changes based on feedback so far.  You can now complete the game!  You move faster, enemies move faster (and there are more of them), the weight mechanic is less cumbersome, and restart functions correctly.\n\nThe original compo version is labeled accordingly.\n\nControls:\n\nWASD to move.  \nShift to dash.  \nSpace to toggle larva call.  \nEscape for menu.  \nE to drop distraction cells.  \nPartial controller support (no menu interaction).  \n\nGather biomass from the green tanks and deliver it to your spawning pool to create larva.  Deliver those larva in turn to grates around the map to infest the research facility.  Once infestation is complete, you can escape into the world!\n\n...except you can't in the original upload, because colliders are not triggers.\n\n\n![Infestus3.png](///raw/dd3/c/z/c228.png)\n\n\nOhh man.  What have I done?  \n\nThe theme was the last one I expected to win.  I had lots of ideas for most the the themes, but uh... this one came out of left field for me.\n\nI decided to try to incorporate the theme in as many facets of the design as I could.  It is worse to have more minions following you because it's harder to sneak around.  It's worse to be burdened with an abundance of MacGuffin, because your movement is inhibited.  It's worse to allow enemies to bunch up, because, well, they are you enemies.  They want to eat you and all that.\n\nI am not thrilled with the finished product.  You can play it through, so that's good.  I probably won't revisit this particular project (LD spaghetti all over the place), but I have learned A TON about pixel art and the associated concerns.  I would really like to move forward with another, more tolerably-paced pixel art project.\n\nAnyway, I hope there's some fun to be had with Infestus.  I had fun making it.  Thanks for checking it out.\n![Infestus1.png](///raw/dd3/c/z/c226.png)\n\n\n![Infestus2.png](///raw/dd3/c/z/c227.png)",

So how do you play this super mega amazing treasure of technology? Well you click this link OBVIOUSLY! https://oxrock.itch.io/pancakes\n\nOh, did you mean the controls? Well that's easy too. Use the (A,D,‚Üê,‚Üí) keys to maneuver the plate and catch all the pancakes. Keep an eye on the light bulb because it moves and changes color to indicate where and when the next pancake is coming.

There's no way someone could make a game so awesome, so amazing in such a short amount of time. I understand your skepticism.

But what will you do to get there? Will you work hard and honestly claw your way to the top or will you let your power and influence corrupt you on the way? What lines would you cross to get to the top?\n\nThe game's goal was to test if the more power you have, the worse your morals would be.\n\n## What's In The Game\n- Day Progression\n- Work Level and Impacts for Slave and Workers\n- Extra Actions 'Engine'\n  - Pick a Name when not a Slave\n  - Get offered a Promotion to Worker\n  - Offer to Bribe a Manager for a Promotion\n- Simple AI\n  - Complete Work Level each Day based on Laziness\n  - Can die\n- Map Generation\n  - Visible Buildings\n  - Visible People\n  - Zoom out from Plot level to Town to Kingdom\n  - 256 possible Plots\n  - 4096 squares\n- Working Status Bar\n- Ability to Die\n- Hand Drawn Art\n\n## What's Not In The Game\n- Proper Gameplay\n  - Needs more (read BASICALLY ALL) extra actions to test use of power\n  - Needs implementation of Manager, Owner, Lord, and King\n  - Needs the ability to progress between, or be kicked back in Jobs\n- Complete AI\n  - Need to be able to complete their own extra actions\n- Build Mechanic\n  - Part of the extra actions plan was to have a build mechanic to open up more options\n  - Ideas included:\n    - Other Buildings\n    - Slave Quarters\n    - Prison\n    - Torture Chamber\n    - Public Whipping Square\n    - Public Execution\n    - Day Spa\n    - Lava Lamp Factory\n- CSS for Portrait Views\n  - Currently looks horrible if screen height is greater than width\n- Better Input/Info Panels\n  - Needs custom dialogue box\n  - Needs the ability to see influence and power over AI's\n  - Needs the ability to check status logs (For now can be viewed in a dev console using `status_log`)\n- Any Audio Whatsoever (This was very low on my priorities list)\n\n## Post-Jam Updates\nI'm planning to continue working on this game and have created a little menu screen to allow people to chose the original compo game or the post-jam updated version. (This was done after submission) Feel free to review the Compo version, but note that it is far from complete. The Post-Jam should be a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nPost-Jam plans can be seen at https://github.com/Lawzy93/power-play/projects/1\n\n### Better Pop-Up Dialogues\n- Popups are no longer web browser default one and look much more a part of the game.\n- This lays the foundations for Influence and Power View and Status Log View\n\n### Status Log View\n- Click on the status bar to view all previous statuses\n\n### Portrait View CSS\n- The game now scales well for all view window sizes\n\n### Influence and Power View\n- By clicking on the scroll icon you can view your influence and power with others.",

It has been harsh and everything, and at the end of the 48 hours I had the result you'll see if you dare to download the game. But I learned a thing or two, and I am a little proud of myself, even if the feedback of the game is unexisting, even if I putted the sound effects in total panic 20 minutes before the end of the 48 hours, etc etc.\n\nLEAVE ME A COMMENT IF YOU PLAY THE GAME, FEEDBACKS ARE MY PASSION\n\n![LudumDare40.gif](///raw/c51/2/z/bfa2.gif)\n\n**ABOUT THE GAME :** \nYou'll have to run through a city in despair, filled with trashbins, drug addicts, and terrible families doing barbecues. The cops are behind you and want you cuffed, so you have to run... But you know that you're a video game character, and you'll have to die sometimes. So you say Carpe Diem, Yolo, fast life and all that kind of stuff and you go nuts on your city.\n\nYou can move, jump on rooftops or street lamps, make childrens cry, get stuck by rain gutters, steal rasta dude's botanic herbs, and see a game finished much too quickly and being glitchy, with a terrible pixel art and sound design by a kid who master nothings for the moment (but with love, and a homeless protagonist) !\nThe goal is to make score... yes, innovative, I know, so I suggest to you to play that with pals so you can rant about the quality of the game in group.\n\nBut the fact is, even if you're homeless, you don't have superpowers : you'll ahve to eat to survive. But you only have rubbish to eat, stealing barbecue's are rare... The more you'll eat, and consume drugs to stay alive, the more you'll lose life and you'll be hungry later ! So, you know what to do... Eat rubish and consume fancy green liquid \u0026 funny plant to cover the side effect of those same products ! ** It's not hell, it's Terry's paradise ! **\n\nHave fun ! ‚ô™\n\n**WORLD CHAMPION :**\n**@piscythe**, with the INCREDIBABLE score of **904,383,500** freakin points. That's some high-level garbage-eating right there. You can check out his game too, there's lava lamps in it, and it's well-deserved !\n\n![200w_d.gif](///raw/c51/2/z/c481.gif)   (yes, that gif looks terrible)\n\n**TOOLS :**\n\nPixel-art : Piskel.com \u0026 Photoshop\n\n\nSound : FL Studio, Beepbox, audacity, GXSCC\n\n\nEngine : Unity (yep, another one) , I used Monodevelop\n\n\nMe : because I used Monodevelop\n\n\nFont : 8-bit wonder , downloadable on dafont.com\n\nI'll retry to make a web version so everyone can play it !\n\nCurrent version : 0.3\nDifferences with the last version : Corrected controls panel text and added a pun.\n\n![LDaffiche.png](///raw/c51/2/z/b8d8.png)\n",

      "Body": "![Screen2.png](///raw/2dd/z/a680.png)\n\nHappy Bot Mess is a turn based tactics game. You control two  military happy  killing bots that have a serious bug: their attack and movement are bound to the number of bullets in their weapon.\n\nFor example, if they have 1/4 bullets in the weapon their movement range is four tiles and they make four damage. If they have a full clip of 4 bullets they can only move one tile and make one damage. Every move also costs a bullet because the Happy Bots are rocket jumping. Choose your moves wisely.\nBy the way these gameplay rules do not apply to the enemies.\n\n**Gameplay Basics**\n\nYour units have *one move* and *one action* per turn. The action can be used for attacking enemies, healing a friend and the unit itself or reloading. Using the action ends the units turn. Use the buttons on the units UI or the number keys 1-4 to select an action. Reloading is done instantly on clicking the button. For attacking and healing you have to select the action. Then all targets in the skill range are highlighted. If no unit is highlighted, you can not use the skill. But that is poorly communicated. When both units actions are used you have to end the turn via enter or the button at the top.\n\n![Unit_stats..png](///raw/2dd/z/dff7.png)\n\n**Linux \u0026 MacOS**\n\nThe game is built with Monogame so it can be run on both platforms with the [Mono Runtime](www.mono-project.com/). On Ubuntu simply install the mono-runtime package and start the .exe of the game via mono HappyBotMess.exe. Sorry that there is no easier solution at the time. I only tested this on Ubuntu but there the game was running without problems.\n\n**Created with:** [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/), [Pyxel Edit](http://pyxeledit.com/), [Bosca Ceoil](http://boscaceoil.net/), [ChipTone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/).\n\nCreated by [S√∂ren Hoffstedt](https://twitter.com/yellowhatgames).

If they're surrounded by too many bacteria, though, they'll take damage instead (get smaller).\n\nKeep in mind, bacteria exist in 3 layers, so there may actually be more bacteria in a given space than there appears -- a good way to gauge this is how opaque they are.\n\nSo in general, a good strategy is to move nanomachines to where there are only a few bacteria, and keep them away from dense populations.\n\nPro tip: As soon as your nanomachines divide the first time, it's probably a good idea to grab one and move it out of the petri dish. That way you always have one in reserve, and don't have to worry about running out of nanomachines.\n\n------------------------\n\nChangelog:\n - Added instruction slides to splash screens (not sure if this violates the spirit of the rules... if so, let me know, and I'll yank 'em)\n - Fixed issue where tile rules weren't working, and only default tile was used.\n - WebGL version still not available, as tiles don't render at all on that platform. If fixable, will upload a WebGL build as soon as possible.\n - Game Over condition was missing for having too much heat. Fixed.\n - Fixed artifacts around Forceps tool.\n - Added Escape key to quit the game.\n - Added Mac and Linux builds (untested).",

Of course, the inebriation induced by the alcohol may cause some involuntary head motions and make hitting the cups slightly more difficult.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nYou throw a ball and attempt to get it in one of the cups. The strength of the throw can be varied and the ball can be controlled after throwing it.\n\nWhen the ball lands in a cup you drink it and get more drunk. This impacts your stability and hearing. The cup is removed from the table. When all the cups on the table have been removed, you get a new set of cups.\n\nYou get points for getting the ball inside the cups. How many points you get depends on what type of cup it is, and it multiplied by the amount of successful throws you have had in a row.\n\nWhen you miss two times in a row you lose a heart. The first time it starts flickering and the second time it goes dark. You regain one heart when you make a successful throw.\n\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![1.PNG](///raw/cbc/c/z/af22.png)\n\nThe hearts represent your hp.\n\nThe bar on the right shows the strength of your throw.\n\nClicking the coin slot on the left opens the menu or restarts the game after game over.\n\n\n![2.PNG](///raw/cbc/c/z/af24.png)\n\nAfter throwing the ball the camera gives you a bird's-eye view of the ball so you can more easily see where it goes.\n\n\n![3.PNG](///raw/cbc/c/z/af27.png)\n\nThe menus\n\n\n# Controls\n\n## Keyboard\n\nHold **space** and release to throw the ball.\n\nPress **escape** or **click on the coin slot** to open the menus or restart the game after a game over.\n\n**WASD / Arrow keys** to move ball.\n\n\n## Controller\n\nHold and release **A** on an Xbox controller or **X** on a PlayStation controller to throw the ball.\n\nPress **start** to open the menus or restart the game after a game over.\n\n**Left joystick / D-Pad** to move ball.",

So in order to collect more coins you have to dispose the already collected ones so you can return to your regular speed.\n\nP.S. I know that this prototype needed much more work to be as a part of ludum dare compo but as my first project i didn't dedicated the time that i should have and also i was still trying to learn the tools of the engine... So yeah it needs a lot of improvement like adding some timer so its a little bit of a challenge and many many more...

Unfortunately, I only had about 8 hours to work on the game this weekend so my leprechaun guy didn't quite make the cut.  The rest of it is more or less as designed.  Other ideas I had for this was to make it a bit more of a platformer game jumping from cloud to could, but I threw out that idea early on as I wanted to focus on a single arcade \"high score\" type of game.\n\n",

Good luck! ;-)\n\n\nAs you might've guessed. Since this game uses naive unoptimized distance field rendering, you have to have a pretty good grafix card for it to work.\n\n\nSince I've hardly ever seen anyone try this before I would be really happy if you mention what the FPS counter said and what graphics card your computer has.\n\n\nThe game works in Firefox \u0026 Chrome.\n\nIt most definitely doesn't work in Edge or Internet Explorer.\n\nI have no idea if it works in Safari or Vivaldi...\n\n\n### Graphics performance on a couple of different cards:\n* Nvidia GTX 660           : 25 fps\n* Nvidia GTX 960m          : 18 fps\n* Intel HD Graphics 530    : 9  fps\n* AMD Radeon r7 series 200 : 5  fps\n* And about 0.5-2.5 fps on a 5 year old low-end 32-bit windows tablets internal Intel HD graphics.\n",

Just don't do it man.\n* Keep an eye out for prices of crucial items. You don't want to be caught with your pants down or overpay for your troops, now do you?\n* Quickly place all 4 walls.

Deal with the crises the dig has unearthed, recover artifacts from the city, and survive the 10 days for rescue to arrive. But be careful, each relic you obtain will drive you closer to insanity, making it harder and harder to fight off the terrors of below!\n\n**Instructions/How To Play:**\n\nAt the end of the game, you need to have more money from relics than was lost on base repairs and the deaths of members of the expedition. Each crisis that isn't resolved adds $100 to your costs, and each death adds $100. Each relic gives you $100 in profit, or an additional $200 if you research it in the Dome.\n\nTo move, click on a character's card, and then click on a room in the base. Each room has a special ability, as does each character that may take specific dice and/or resources. Of particular focus is the digsite: this is where you acquire your relics, and the dome, where you learn what they do.\n\nYou can click and drag dice once you roll them using the button. Dice in the Dice Hold are not rerolled if you click the roll button again, and you can drag the dice to any of the glowing squares to use them there. Crises in rooms need a total value of dice added, and each die reduces it, while other abilities may require specific die values, or dice with a certain value, denoted with an arrow pointing up.\n\nTools used: Unity 2017.2, Visual Studio, Photoshop, Inkscape",

Just don't kill yourself while doing it.\n\n## HTML5 Version on Gamejolt (with broken audio :'( ):\n\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/internet-points/301376\n\n\n# HOW TO PLAY\n\nGameplay revolves around \"designing\" stunts using a madlibs-style interface. When you do a stunt, you get followers, and then you can sell your followers' data to various interested parties. This allows you to convert followers to money. Money can then be used to unlock new stunts.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\n* Design and perform unique stunts\n* Gain followers\n* Sell data from your followers\n* Use money to unlock new stunt types\n* Rinse and repeat until you die\n\n\n# STUNT OUTCOMES\n\nEach stunt consists of three main values:\n\n* Risk percentage: The chances of an accident/injury occurring\n* Danger: The health lost if you have an accident/injury\n* Stupidity level: A special value with some situational bonuses. The main benefit is that getting away with stupid things increases your \"dumb luck\" stat. This stat reduces your risk. \n\n## Healing\n\nAccidents are unavoidable, so when they do happen be sure to heal yourself. Press the [SPACE BAR] at any time to switch views and find your medications and car keys (so you can go to the hospital).\n\nEvery time you use medicine, you increase your tolerance to it. If that happens, make sure you go to the hospital, because the drugs there are much stronger. HOWEVER, you can still build up a tolerance to the hospital's drugs (but more slowly). There's no other way to heal, so try to avoid having to use them!\n\n\n## REWARDS FOR DOING STUPID THINGS\n\nThis includes avoiding an accident in a stunt with 50%, or having an accident in a stunt with less than 50% risk. Doing any of those things increase your dumb luck. The \"dumb luck\" stat decreases your overall risk, so if you have a lot of it, you can probably get away with doing something incredibly risky.\n\n# Gameplay formulas\n\nIf you REALLY want to know how the reward system works, look at the class PlayData in the file PlayData.hx in the source code. I tried to write something that would make the game at least playable, but I think it could have benefited with more time for play testing. The statistics tied to the various stunts are just numbers I came up with on the spot, and tweaked a bit with very limited testing. I don't even know if it's possible to unlock them all. :\\",

So prioritize your activites for maximum effect. Don't fall behind, but don't under-prioritize your friends and family either.\n\nGood luck!! And remember! The more activities you have to balance, the worse it gets!\n\n\n## Information\n\n\"The Precarious Balance\" is a turn-based strategy game. It was made in Java, using the LibGDX framework. The art was made using Aseprite\n\nThe game is controlled by mouse. All controls have tooltips when you hover your cursor over them.\n\n## Added experimental HTML version\nI have added an experimental HTML version. I have played through the entire game using that version, so it should be working, but it requires a relatively high resolution. If you experience any problems, please write a comment. In any case, the Java stand-alone version can be used as a fall-back, if needed. \n\n*update 4th December: One of my players pointed out that the Java version was broken, due to a wrong resolution setting. I've uploaded a new Java version which fixes this. This was purely a settings-fix, with no changes to gameplay*",

I may have gotten carried away with designing demons, leading me to run out of time to add sound during the compo. I highly recommend playing the Post Jam version though, since sound contributes a lot to the theme, I think.\n\nThe demon concept was partially inspired by [ctrlcreep's Inconvenience Demon series](https://www.patreon.com/ctrlcreep/posts), which I would highly recommend.

Not only being injured improves both the damage output and the firing rate of your gun, but it also widens your field of view.\n\n===========================================================\n\nMade in 48-hours from the Ludum Dare Compo by Jordi Tudela Alcacer using:\n- Unity 5.6.3p2\n- Photoshop\n- Bosca Ceoil\n\n===========================================================\n\n# Directions\n\nJust kill the enemies, avoid getting hit by anything dangerous and try to manage your health efficiently. The crates may contain a health package that increases your life points by 1 or an ammunition bonus that allows you to fire three bullets at once.\n\n- **W-A-S-D**: move\n\n- **Mouse**: aim\n\n- **Mouse 1**: shoot\n\n- **Space**: jump\n\n- **P**: Pause\n\n\n============================================================\n\n# MODES\n\n- **Play**: try to complete 3 levels of increasing difficulty, you just have to reach the reach the door at the end of the level.\n\n- **Arena**: How much time can you survive in this close arena? Try to get those crates to increase your chances!\n\n============================================================\n\n# COMMENTS\n- Both the Mac OSX version and the Linux version are untested.\n\n===========================================================\n\n# Bugs\n\n- Jump is not always responsive\n- The enemies should leave a white silhouette behind.

I believe that the total amount of time I worked on this game is less than 12 hours.\n\nThe controls are relatively straightforward:\n- Scroll to zoom in/out.\n- Hold the middle mouse button and drag to pan.\n- Click on the tower types in the upper-right corner to select them.\n- Click on the ground in order to place a tower.\n- Click the 'play' button in the lower-left corner to start the next wave.\n\nHopefully everything else is relatively self-explanatory. The enemies move along the red path. If they get to the goal, you lose lives; if you lose all your lives, you lose the game. The battery-looking symbol represents currency; the lower-left corner shows your current currency and the amount required to purchase a tower is displayed next to each tower.\n\nTowers have several basic differences. In order from top to bottom as listed on screen:\n- Range of 6 grid squares; shoots every 0.7 seconds; does 1-2 damage; projectiles travel 6 grid squares per second\n- Range of 6 grid squares; shoots every 2 seconds; does 5-8 damage; projectiles travel 4 grid squares per second\n- Range of 10 grid squares; shoots every 0.05 seconds; does 0.1-0.7 damage; projectiles travel 8 grid squares per second",

The city will grow depending on how well you keep it powered.\n\nDon't grow too quickly though, as the city mayor won't tolerate many power outages before terminating your contract.\n\n**Instructions and tips:**\n- Build your first power plant away from the starting city block. Citizens dislike living close to power plants, substations and high voltage nodes.\n- Connect your power plant to a substation with high voltage lines. The substation lowers the voltage to residential values.\n- Connect the substation to the residential areas using low voltage lines, people don't mind these near their houses.\n- The city will grow into new blocks and upgrade existing ones much faster into well powered and valued areas.\n- The city won't tolerate three power outages in a single month.\n- Don't grow your grid too fast at the start of the game, or else the city power demand will get unmanageable quickly.\n- If you pollute too much, the city will start imposing penalties by taxing your income.\n- Base price per kWh varies each month, by external factors you cannot control.\n- You can see the currently powered zones by using the \"POWER\" button on the left.\n\n**‚ÄãMissing features (maybe I'll implement them post-jam):**\n- More important than anything else: **Balance**. I didn't have enough time to better playtest the game and set enjoyable costs, rates, and other values.‚Äã\n- ‚ÄãSaving and loading games. Also very important as games can get long.\n- Info on city buildings (how much each kind consumes, etc.).\n- Random events and offers. These should affect the kWh price, grow rate, and any other variable.\n- Not programmer art.\n- Music. For now get on Youtube and search for an Instrumental Jazz playlist to play while you play the game.\n\nI'm pretty happy with results even with the missing features.

Only Jetpack June can ascend the tower and stop what ever nefarious scheme is going on inside... The Tower of Power!\n\n\n#### [Source on Bitbucket (git)](https://bitbucket.org/Canazza/ld-39-running-out-of-power)\n\n### Developer Notes\n\nSo this is probably my most ambitious Ludum Dare game to date, the key component of managing your jetpack energy came right at the start, but making it a difficult boshy-like game came after. That may not have been the best idea as I was making level content for it right up until an hour before I submitted it, and that last hour was taken up by making the intro music.\n\nI usually spend the last half a day making music for LD games, so this was a fumble on my part.\n\nAs such I recommend you listen to your own music while playing. I recommend anything by AC/DC, any power-metal, RCHP's 'Zephyr Song', Rocketman, Let's Go fly a kite... \n\nThere does appear to be a bug on the WebGL version where the jetpack exhaust doesn't stop when you enter a 2-tile high corridor. The ability itself stops (so you're not wasting any fuel) but the graphic doesn't. This only happens on the WebGL version and I only noticed it after publishing and didn't have time to fix it. it doesn't appear to happen on the Windows version, so if it gets annoying try the download link.\n\n## Development Videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX82jPFES0c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBDZL0RsR4g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP0XdVkCzW4\n",

It's clear there's still a lot of work to do (and engine code to write) to get good at building games quickly - especially as my style is to build as much of the system from scratch as possible.\n\nI hope the game is pretty self explanatory, but in case it isn't: After starting the game, your job is to hold the mouse button to fire the energy beam, and guide the beam to the target (red orb), then hold it there to charge the orb and open the next level. Try not to waste too much power or you might not be able to escape the facility which is slowly running out of power. The narration / text dialogs are unskippable, sorry.",

Had a great time working on it, even though I didn't have as much time as I would have liked (other obligations).\n\nGame was created using Clickteam Fusion 2.5, PyxelEdit, Photoshop, and sfxr for sounds.\n\nSomehow I managed to click the Do Not Rate Me On Graphics box at some point, but that is wrong.  All of the graphics were created by me during the Compo.  I've fixed the checkbox, but of course now there is a hole in my ratings.  If you liked the graphics, and are looking at this again, please take the time to rate them.  Thanks in advance.\n\n### Gameplay Question\nI'm seeing several comments about the handling of the ship being hard, or the controls being difficult. I've played this in 4 different browsers in 3 different operating systems, and it appears to behave as I'm expecting.  If you experience something odd, please describe in as much detail as you can what you feel is wrong and I will see what I can do to address it in the evolution build.\n\n### YouTube Demo\nCreated this video to show gameplay and maybe get feedback on performance vs. what others are seeing.\n#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Eaf8ACdPgc\n\n### Known issues:\n- Enemy ships spawn randomly inside the game field, which results in unavoidable collisions some times.\n- Random seed isn't random yet.\n- Physics engine has an issue when exported to HTML5 as best I can tell.  Had to reduce thrust to very low levels to make it playable in web interface, which makes it too slow to be viable in CTF.\n- If you shoot at overlapping enemies, one of the dropped energy pods scales wrong and is stuck in one spot\n\n### Roadmap for the future:\n- Add additional power-ups\n- Improve enemy logic (enemies avoid colliding with each other, ie: no overlap)\n- Add tractor beam to collect energy pods rather than colliding with them\n- Add music\n- Add animations (engines, ships exploding, maybe slight parallax in the background)\n- Power bar on ship?\n- Score breakdown on game over screen\n- Add additional enemies (tougher enemies)\n- Add enemy combat functions (shooting, mines, etc)\n- Possibly convert the game to a panning view rather than a static screen with warping\n- Add a mobile port\n- ???\n\n### 2 August 2017 Notes\nThank you everyone for the amazing feedback.  It's really great to hear the suggestions and comments.  Ironically, many of the suggestions being made are things I already have planned for the game but just didn't have time to get done during the Compo.  I have already started adding a few things which you can find at the link below.  The main HTML5 (Web) link at the bottom is still the one to use for rating the game.  All in all this has been a great experience and I'm already hyped and looking forward to the next Ludum Dare.\n\n### 6 August 2017 Notes\nWork continues on the evolution build.  I've added in some new features, detailed in the list below.  Once you have played the submitted version of the game, please play the updated game and see how it has changed.\n\n##### THESE ARE THE LD39 SUBMISSION LINKS FOR RATING (This is what was completed during the Compo, and should be used to rate the game)\n- HTML5 LD39 Submission http://www.spetsdod.com/ld39\n- LD39 Submission Source http://www.spetsdod.com/ld39/source.zip\n\n##### THIS IS THE POST EVEN UPDATES LINK\n##### DO NOT RATE ME ON THE FOLLOWING LINK\n- HTML5 Post Event Updates http://www.spetsdod.com/ld39-evolution\n\nThis is where I will continue to add in new features after the event.\n#### Added:\n- High Energy Pod Drop from random enemy ships\n- Updated Start screen with scoring changes\n- Fixed random seed so ships should appear more randomly now (still spawning in the playfield - haven't fixed that yet)\n- Post game score breakdown\n- Fixed enemy spawning inside the frame.  No more unavoidable collisions\n- Enemy speed increases slightly every 30 seconds\n- Added explosion animation when enemies are destroyed",

Select the actions available to you or press 'h' followed by the associated key to get a short description.  You may also activate Turbo Mode to skip the confirmation step and increase the game speed.\n(Sorry, mouse/touch controls not implemented in this version)\n\nAbout the making of this game:\nI literally just moved into an apartment in Taiwan the day before this LD began.  I currently have no internet access nor a working phone, and last night (the first day of the compo) we were hit directly by a Category 2 Typhoon.  I walked about a mile to find open wifi with my phone so that I could find out what the theme is and start on my entry, more than a full day after the compo began, so I ended up with fewer than 23 hours to make my entry.  I'm really satisfied with the result, though, and I hope you are too!  Thanks for playing!\n\n-----\n![LD39-Shot1.PNG](///raw/da3/1/z/6107.png)\n\n------\n![LD39-Shot2.PNG](///raw/da3/1/z/610f.png)",

As long as they are in the darkness, they are invisible to you. However, using your lamp's abilities will help to detect them and ultimately destroy them. Be careful, though, if they manage to sneak up on you they will drain your lamp's energy. When it runs out, the game is over.\n\n***\n\n### Instructions\nLamplight is a turn-based dungeon crawler on a hex grid. The objective is to clear as many rooms as you can before running out of lamp energy (which will happen sooner or later). Monsters are invisible until you use your lamp's abilities on them. Bright light will stun monsters, making them vulnerable. They also leave tracks as they move, allowing you to try to deduce where they are in the darkness. Follow the tutorial in the first room to learn the basics.\n\nThere isn't a ton of content in the game unfortunately, you'll see everything there is to see on a reasonable run. I feel like the concept was communicated quite well and turned out to be decently fun though.\n\n***\n\n### About\nThis is my second Ludum Dare. Last time I submitted a \"jam\" game. I had plenty of time and managed to finish quite early, so this time I thought I'd go ahead and do \"compo\". It was definitely much more of a struggle, I don't think I had as solid of an idea as I did last time, and shaving that extra day off really does a number psychologically. I definitely wasn't able to execute all the ideas I had, and I wish I could have squeezed in one or two more enemies at least. It was a great experience, though, and I managed to at least finish a playable product!\n\n***\n\n### Tools Used\n- Game Maker: Studio 1.4\n- Bfxr (sound effects)\n- JamStudio.com (music)\n- Audacity (sound + music editing)\n- MS Paint (doodles that pass as graphics)\n\nAll assets are original, as per compo rules.\n\n***\n\n### Post-Submission Changes\n- v1.01 - Fixed a subtle bug I found *right after* I submitted.\n- v1.02 - Added android support.\n- v1.03 - On Windows made the game window resizable (some players with high-res monitors were having a hard time playing the game).\n- V1.03YYC - Re-compiled Windows and Android to run natively (GM's Yo-Yo Compiler) for optimization boosts (didn't really need it, but it might be nice for some mobile users). Also got a build working for Linux.\n- Got a web build up and running! Took some finagling, but I think it was worth it for the much easier access.\n\n***\n\n![android_art.png](///raw/91b/3/z/80dd.png)\nIf you're up for it, try it on Android! I think Lamplight feels really good on mobile.\n\n***\n\n**Note:** The HTML5 version requires WebGL, not all browsers support this. Also if you have an ultra-wide or 4K display, it might be more comfortable to use a non-web version so you can scale the game window up.\n",

Don't run out of fuel! \n\nThere are computer-controlled players as well but you're playing against yourself (they're just after the same fuel). How many rockets can you build?\n\n![simple_gameplay_looping.gif](///raw/c93/z/6709.gif)\n\n![basic_1.jpg](///raw/c93/z/660d.jpg)\n\nThere's intentionally no end game, it's a how-much-can-you-do-before-running-out-of-fuel thing. The balance that's in the submitted version is intentionally a bit easier than I was playing it by the end of the weekend, but interested to hear how others get on. I'll likely put up a version with \"effects off\" for low-spec machines, so might include a difficulty toggle in that as a post-compo version.\n\n-- \n\nTools and stuff: Unity for game engine, no plugins apart from the beta of Unity's own post processing stack and their example particle effects package. Maya for modelling. Illustrator for textures. Music done in Ableton Live. Sound effects all vocals into mic and edited in Audacity \u0026 Audition.\n\n--\n\n## Post-compo update\n\nBased on the initial comments (in which everybody pointed out the controls), I've done a post-compo build that uses relative left/right controls. I've only changed the directionality of the controls to make sure that the post-compo version is as close to the original compo version as possible, while giving people what is obviously a more generally preferable control scheme. The link to the original compo version is below.\n\nOriginal compo builds (controls are world relative): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dy6fdpyh5fnjrst/AADg7FD5GI2t6x2TvXYF_fU7a?dl=0\n\nPersonally I prefer the post-compo (more visibly drifty controls) for fun, but the original compo controls for the challenge and this specific game. If I were to develop this further I'd go for some balance between the two, but likely also change some of the fuel placement and map details to better suit the relative controls.\n",

When you run out of power there is a 1 to 1.5 second delay before you get the game over screen \n3. It seems I forgot to set the distance to 0 if you restart the game with out closing it first.

Left click on a building to see it's stats, the portals can also be upgraded. Solar panels must be near the sun, harvestors must then be near the solar panels to connect them to the main grid. Charging stations take energy from the main grid, but they can be placed anywhere. Ships come through the portals and have a chance that they'll need fuel, so they'll find the nearest charging station to go to that is available, once it has found one that charging station is in use so no other ship can go to it until the ship has charged. Ships can clip through walls because the future is magical and beyond collisions... ... .. . .\n\n## Upgrades\n\nA lot of people have been commenting about upgrades, due to a lack of time I was only able to implement one upgrade on the portal, so don't worry about them not working :slight_smile:\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![2017-07-30 (1).png](///raw/94/z/5ad3.png)\n\n![2017-07-30 (2).png](///raw/94/z/5ad4.png)\n\n![2017-07-30 (3).png](///raw/94/z/5ad5.png)\n\n![2017-07-30 (4).png](///raw/94/z/5ad6.png)\n\n![2017-07-30 (5).png](///raw/94/z/5ad7.png)",

Note: I didn't explain any of the below hints to him](https://streamable.com/c1yv6)\n\n## Hints and Spoilers\n\n__Hint 1__ The base circle expands and shrinks based on how much energy the base has.  \n__Hint 2__ The circle is the capture radius for the enemies and a heal radius for you (don't let it get too large else enemies will be able to start capturing it faster)  \n__Hint 2__ The enemies start capturing the base when they're inside the circle.  \n__Hint 3__ Base heals you if you're within the circle range at a cost of 1 energy for 1 durability.  \n__Hint 4__ Base gets energy surges / replenishment at specific time intervals, so don't be shy to use the 'F' skill, but do use it wisely else you will run out of energy.  \n__Hint 5__ If multiple enemies are capping the base, killing one will not reset the timer (hint: use F skill if more than 1 enemy are capping the base)  \n\n\n\nLD39 is my 2nd LD entry, first one was LD38. I think I made a significant improvement. Took me about 29 to 30 hours of total work time to finish this. I sacrificed a lot of sleep.... time to sleep for 12 hours.

Press the *ENGAGE* button to execute the actions you marked as \"use\" (green).\n\n***\n\n**HINTS:**\n* Music and/or sound can be turned off from the Menu (top right corner).\n* After each round the bottom panel will refill with new actions, replacing the ones you used/discarded.\n* Try to keep the power drain as low as possible, to avoid losing big chunks of power at the end of a round (current power drain is displayed on the power bar, right side of the screen).\n* Remember to discard actions (right click) which you don't think you are going to need any time soon.\n* Some actions are rarer than others (e.g. Auto Repair). Consider holding on to those a bit longer.\n* Avoid asteroids, and especially enemy drones, which attack you! Enemy drones can be destroyed with one laser shot.\n* Remember to save a Stabilizer action for when you are traveling at high speed - or to prevent knock back from enemy fire or asteroid collisions.\n* Don't shoot the power-ups! They give you a large power boost when you collide with them.\n* You start right in the center of the asteroid field, and you can fly any direction you want to escape.",

Drag coal by left-clicking anywhere in the coal cart into the generators.\n2. You can buy coal underneath the cart. Left click over the \"0\" on the bottom left and use it as an input field(It's counter intuitive I know...)\n3. The more coal you buy the cheaper it is but the longer it will take to arrive. \n4. All the energy gets dumped into the battery and from there you'll feed the demand. You can buy extra battery storage space by clicking on the button underneath it.\n5. You can only have 8 generators. You can buy them in the bottom center for 50‚Ç¨.  \n6. Important, the number on the bottom right is the money you have. \n\n__Last as much as you can!__\n(There is no time counter to know how long you lasted. This is for one sole reason... I suck!)\n\n## Description\n\nThis is my second Ludum Dare. I thought I'd get way more time to learn and practice between events but due to work this didn't happen. It's always gratifying to finish a game, even if it's a piece of shit. In this case, lets face it, a HUMONGOUS piece of crap. I was definitely rusty both on unity and c# for this challenge. It took me a long time to get comfortable with the whole thing. After the first 6h it was clear to me that the game ideas was not good, and I was having to much trouble executing it. In summary, you are watching the remains of the battlefield between me and Unity's UI system...and I was massacred. I did learn a bunch so I won't hide in the basement to cry ;)\nPS: The ‚Ç¨ thing instead of $ is intended.\n\n__Some Notes for the future:__\n- I spent a lot of time reading the Unity Scripting API, UnityAnswers forum and StackOverflow to refresh a lot of things I already know. Next time do a 1 day intensive warm-up the week before or less intense during the whole week. \n\n## Tools\n- Unity 5.6\n- Audacity (for Sound)\n- Lunapic (for Graphics)\n- Bosca Ceoil (For the music)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t419vnv3ev4sdgh/EnergyTycoonSource.zip?dl=0)\n- [Win32](https://www.dropbox.com/s/medqephbxwi1we4/CoalGameWin.zip?dl=0)\n- [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/beueb2me9tbpc2u/CoalGameMac.app.zip?dl=0)\n- [Web](https://gris.itch.io/Coal-Game)\n\n## 48hours + Noob = Bugs\n\nI probably won't fix anything since I didn't like the idea or execution. This is just an acknowledgement of bugs and things lacking.\n\n- No timer to know how long you last. \n- No main menu.\n- No pause button.\n- Better screen adjustment to resize stuff according with screen.\n- Maybe keep a record of highscores?\n- Total lack of animations(It's horrible in general but it could've used some anyway)",

Just click anywhere one the turbine's blades and, keeping the mouse held, draw circles rapidly around the turbine.

Help him climb out of the caves, and make sure he gets enough mushrooms to eat before he starves!\n\nThe caves here are randomly generated, so the game is different every time you play!\n\nTo play:\nArrow keys - move\nZ - jump\nDown - dig a hole\nUp - climb most surfaces\n\nI can't believe I finished this in time. It is pretty bare bones, but I am happy with it. I wish I had the time to add in enemies, but there you go.\n\nCongrats to everyone who finished LD39!\n\n-PBG![PICO-8_3.gif](///raw/c5a/9/z/5d4b.gif)\n\n--PROTIP 1: EAT TONS OF MUSHROOMS! Seriously, hoard them, especially on level 1. Harry will get jump and speed bonuses for filling his blue bar, and these make later levels much easier.![harry_speed.gif](///raw/c5a/9/z/8af5.gif) \n\n![harry_jump.gif](///raw/c5a/9/z/8af6.gif)\n\n--PROTIP 2: If you get a really hard level 1... just start over! The game is procedurally generated, and there is a wide swing in difficulty.\n\n-edit 1: Thanks to @benjamin for this suggestion. To try and point out that you CAN in fact beat a level, I added a blinking arrow when you get near the exit. I also gave Harry some stuff to say so that it is clear that this is a game and not just an engine demo.\n\nLastly, I am trying to address the difficulty. I altered the RNG so that more mushrooms will appear on tough maps. Also, I added a super jump for when you need to jump far - this uses up food though.\n\n--edit 2: After reading the official rules for Ludum Dare, I removed the super-jump that I just added. My level generator was generating jups that were too far to make without any powerups, so i thought it would be clever to have a super-jump to make them. However, this is too much of a new feature, so i removed it. I DID fix my generator, so that jumps that look too far should now have a ladder - this was originally intended but the ladder did not actually extend farther than the hole it was coming from, making the jump impossible. I kept some of the text in, since this clarifies that the game CAN be beaten.",

      "Body": "A game made by Milan \"Micito\" Trajkoviƒá in 48 hours for LudumDare 39 Compo.\n\nPower Planner is a game about managing your city's power levels. In the game player has multiple generators\nthat they can power on and off at will, and they provide power. While powered generators are getting damaged, and if they are destroyed, player can't use them until they are fully repaired.\n\nBuildings generate tasks that need to be done. Tasks require power to be executed, some will lose the progress, if they lose power access. In order for building to perform tasks player needs to click on them, to power them. While they are powered they will consume power to progress the task. Task progression is scaled by the efficiency (amount of power you are producing/ amount of power required) so if your efficiency is low, tasks will progress slower, and also the generators will struggle and get damaged even more. So try to keep the efficiency high.\n\nIf you fail 3 tasks, the game ends and you are presented with the score you achieved.\n\nThe game has 3 level types that are randomly generated with predefined power generators (each level type uses different generators). Sadly didn't get the chance to make it so the player can pick which generators they want to play with.\n\nMove the camera using WASD and zoom in and out with numpad + and -, or scroll wheel.\n\nThe game might not be balanced, I didn't have much time to play and balance the game properly.\n\nGame was made with:\n   -Unity2D (GameEngine)\n   -Blender (All building images were generated using blender)\n   -Photoshop (Mostly for tutorial images)\n   -Bfxr (The game has only one sound that is played on click :D.

You're trying to recharge it, so you can leave the planet, but...you need a power source.\n\n![Unity 2017-07-30 18-19-51-66.png](///raw/332/z/619a.png)\n\n**PSA**: When downloading the game, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD A VERSION WITH THE \"Jam\" SUFFIX.  I've already started crunching on a post-LD version that I'd like to sell sometime, and the files are available publicly while I work out what needs to go into going commercial with it.\n\nYou've got to finish recharging your escape-pod, but there are alien/zombie/things after you and your ship.  If they can get in, it's over.\n\nYou have to manage your power system (don't let the generators or batteries go down), your health (try not to die), and your ammo (you have a limited number of spare magazines, so don't just waste them after shooting one bullet).  You can build things to help (such as toggleable medical machines or ammo factories), but it'll cost valuble power you could be using for your ship.\n\nFollow the Win/Mac/Nix links to get to the Itch page in order to download the game.\n**IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE VERSION LABELED \"JAM\" FOR YOUR SYSTEM.**  I'm already working on a post-jam version that I may even eventually take to the markets proper, and the first real post-jam release for that is already available on GitHub and Itch, and it does not accurately represent the original experience; there's music, SFX, and loads of polish/new features that were NOT part of the original Ludum Dare entry.\n\nMade in less than 24 hours for the compo.  Whoooo boyyyyyyy\n\n![Dude.gif](///raw/332/z/61ab.gif)\n\n(Oh hey one other thing: If you're going to rate, please, please, PLEASE leave a comment too.  I'm trying to gauge if I'm actually really onto something with this idea, and anon ratings, even anon for the sake of \"not hurting feelings\" or \"not being That Guy\" are probably worse than any comment you could possibly leave.)\n\nIf you need help with the controls: Spacebar to toggle weapon holster, R to reload/toggle buildmode, LMB to shoot/build things in buildmode, mousewheel to change selected building, and RMB to wire stuff up.  R/LMB both do different things based on if your gun is out or not.\n\nOh, and the font ingame is Coda, licensed under the Open Font License.  I use it for, like, everything at this point.  It's a good font, Bront.\n\nFinally, in the interest of openness: The post-LD bugfixes/changes I've made that're designed to make sure people can actually, like, play and stuff.\n\n * Win Condition: I don't know entirely HOW I managed to screw this up, but about an hour after I'd put the game up and was playtesting, I found that the win condition...just didn't trigger.  I still don't know WHY it wasn't triggering, but mucking around and removing some safety features from the Escape Batteries seems to have fixed it.  ./shruggyface\n * Wire Lock: I don't know how THIS broke, too, but...something seems to cause the wiring system to outright lock up sometimes when you mis-click, so...I made it reset all the wire variables if you toggled buildmode or weapons.\n * Bullets Breaking: This was one of those things that kept getting pushed back until the \"OH GOD IT'S THE LAST HOUR AHHH\" rush at which point it was forgotten.  I had to do some slightly hacky things to get bullets working, and one of them was a timer that stopped it from immediately colliding with stuff, like the player.  This is why people kept seeing bullets just...not colliding for some reason, although some of the stories I've heard make me wonder if it was more than just my hacky timer that was broken.\n * HTML5: There originally was no HTML5 version, and I made some slight tweaks/copied the project to compile it with Unity 5.6 (because I still use 5.0 for its functional Mac builds and such), so...this maybe is important?",

I didn't have a lot of time so I went with the \"higher level\" functions of HTML5 compared to C++ to save some time and it has the added benefit of being extremely platform independent. The graphics/images could have been a lot better but I ran out of time and energy to keep working on them.\n\n### Tools\n- Images: Photoshop\n- Music: http://earslap.com/page/otomata.html, Audacity\n- Sounds: http://www.bfxr.net/, Audacity\n- Editor: Notepad++\n\n### EDIT\n\nW,A,S,D works now in Chrome, Firefox and Edge\n\nsome people mentioned that W,A,S,D didn't move the dog, it worked in Chrome but didn't in Firefox \u0026 Edge. I actually tested all of these browsers with the offline version before uploading and they all worked fine, but I only tested the chrome version after uploading. Firefox uses some kind of fast loading javascript thing that apparently didn't want to work when using 'const', I changed everything back to magic numbers and now it works. ",

This was the first time I used Blender for modeling and animation and the first time I tried to make music in LMMS. Hope you enjoy the game, and don't press alt+f4 when you get to scared ;)  \n\nThe game takes place in a procedurally generated maze, meaning that each maze you play is unique! The goal is to find a green goal box which is located somewhere inside the maze. Pick up new batteries and light balls as you walk through the maze, but be wary, an enemy lurks in the maze!\n\nDon't forget to play it with sound, preferably a good headset with good 3D sound.

      "Body": "******* Instructions ********\n\nThis is a local two-player cooperative game, though you can player it by yourself, aswell. Each player controls one of the rabbits and each rabbit holds controls part of the flying drone: one player aims and the other shoots. It's meant to be played by two players side by side, one using the keyboard and the other the mouse. The controls are in the title screen. You can customize the controls, instructions for that are in the Readme file.\n\nPlease leave a comment :)\n\n*************************************\n\nI wanted to copy the Bungee Buddies minigame from WarioWare: Smooth Moves and add some things into the mix. The idea was to make a game for two players using a single Wiimote-Nunchuk. After a few hours, I realized I was going to spend the entire weekend messing with technical stuff and that even if I succeeded, most of my potential players don't own a Wiimote and a bit of effort is required to connect one to your PC (at least on Windows).\n\nSo, I dropped the idea of having the players physically jump. And for the compo, I decided to have it use the keyboard and mouse.\n\nI think it's interesting, but I didn't quite nail it. Despite having spent most of Sunday creating and balancing the difficulty progression, I feel it's too easy for me, so it's ultimately kind of boring. It could definitely use more content, too.\n\nWhat I learned from making this is that, for this type of game, you need to carefully consider your restraints for generating obstacles. The biggest difficulty I had was with the energy: energy is health and ammo in this game, so how much energy the players receive is what affects the balance most. You need to make sure the game doesn't become unreasonable at any point, but if you don't design your game correctly, it becomes very hard to make sure it's neither too easy nor too hard. I get the feel that there's some crucial design change I need to make to avoid this problem.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading! I hope you have fun with the game!\n\nUPDATE: You can now customize your controls.\n\n\n![start.png](///raw/512/z/61d9.png)\n\n![screenshot1.png](///raw/512/z/61db.png)\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/512/z/61df.png)\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/512/z/61e5.png)\n",

Releasing near a spawner will order your sells to try and capture it. To complete a level, you must control all spawners. The camera can be moved using middle mouse button and to cancel the currently selected group of cells from being moved, you can pres right mouse button. Escape can be used to pause the game.\n\nSometimes cells will merge with each other, these makes a bigger more powerful cell which has more health and does more damage against other cells.\n\nThank you for playing, I will try to play and rate anyone who comments on my game.\n\nLinux build works but might have a lower frame rate than it should, now with added 64 bit support (I think).

To do so, you must first get close enough that Earth is in range of the FTL drive.\nIn this case, that means you'll have to jump enough to traverse 80 lightyears. Then, Earth will show up when you use the Sensors room as a possible jump location.\n\n‚ÄãEach jump requires the jump charge to be at least 3, and if it's only 3 or 4, a successful piloting check is necessary to avoid 2 hull damage. The next jump location can be chosen by using the Sensors room, otherwise it is randomly drawn from the top of the jump location deck.\n\n‚ÄãClick on crew member meeples to select them, and then click on rooms to move and perform an action there. If a room is on fire, in the middle of a mutiny, or has alien invaders, you won't be able to use the system there until those problems are resolved first. Similarly, you can use a room while it's damaged, unless there are as many damages to the room as people it can hold.\n\n‚ÄãEach location has a unique deck of crises to deal with from alien lifeforms attacking your crew, to hostile spaceships or explosions.\n\nTools used: Unity 2017.1, Photoshop, Inkscape, Bxfr, Audiotool\n\nBugfixes: Fixed bug where being able to shoot more enemies then there were would cause the game to freeze",

A malicious entity is roaming your house looking to kill you, it can only be slowed down with light, your only hope is to survive until dawn by feeding every piece of fuel you can find into the furnace to keep the lights on and keep the monster at bay! Having lights on will slow the entity down as it walks through a room, but will consume more power.\n\nControls:\nWASD - Move around\nMouse - Look around\nE - Interact\nMouse button - Use axe (once acquired)\n\n![StaticMan2s.png](///raw/2d9/1/z/66d9.png)![StaticMan3s.png](///raw/2d9/1/z/66da.png)\n\n[Issues: Collision with the axe is a little bit finicky with some objects, mostly tables and wooden doors, if you aren't getting the hit (there will be a sound) then try stepping away a bit or facing more up or down.\nEvery difficulty is possible, but I recommend playing on Normal.]\n\n[Tips: The keys might cause confusion - ideally they would have been colour coded. The \"store key\" unlocks the door in the corridor, the \"kitchen key\" unlocks the two doors between the furnace and the kitchen, the two front doors only open at dawn.  Finding the key, getting the axe, and smashing up everything made of wood to stick in the fire, is the way to survive. Wood gives more fuel than paper - but paper can be picked up before you have the axe: paintings and books.]\n\nGame was created using the standard First person controller asset that comes with Unity.\n\n[Edit]\nI've uploaded a video walkthrough of normal mode, don't watch unless you don't mind having the whole playthrough spoiled:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptci2_tqusQ\u0026",

Tried to make it somewhat responsive so you could play fullscreen with F11 if you'd like. I used requireJS just o ease the work of loading different JS files on the fly, and some jQuery is thrown in for good measure. Oh, and not to forget - SFXR for the sound.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter reading the rules I realized some bugfixes are allowed with a changelog highlighting changes, wish I realized this right after so everyone didn't have to play with the broken collision.\n\nChangelog:\n- V1.1 Fixed collision a bit, not perfect but removed alot of wierd sticking to corners.\n\nYou can play here: [GAME LINK](https://pontus-persson.github.io/ld38/)\n\nPS. If you are interested you can press Insert/Delete to toggle debug mode that basically shows performance (top left is ms between logic updates, and top right is ms between rendering updates) and some debugging lines and stuff I needed when I was trying to figure out collision that kinda made a pretty sweet effect.\n\n![example.png](///raw/463/3/z/709.png)\n\nHere's the source: [Source](https://github.com/pontus-persson/ld38/)\n\n",

Once a mushroom is\n    fully grown it can be eaten by a Troll.\n\n**Mining, Resources \u0026 Building**\n  * Mining allows the Trolls to gather Stone and Gold.\n  * These are used to build the Troll Castle (which is the objective\n    of the game).\n  * The status bar at the top of the screen shows how much Stone and\n    Gold the Trolls have, as well as the progress towards building\n    the Troll Castle.\n  * Walls must be built first - completely covering the yellow Sand\n    square. After that, a Tower must be built on each corner.\n    Finally, each Tower can be upgraded to a Gold Tower by pressing\n    Space.

Current plan is to stream progress on Saturday afternoons (US Pacific time). Will update this section with new builds as I make progress.\n* [Post-Jam build #1](http://akkit.org/ld48/LD38_sgstair_PostJam1.zip), +3 hours, finished resource collection, building, attacking buildings. [Stream VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/140715979)\n* Following Saturday, implemented population limit, started but didn't finish an input refactoring.\n* There's a bunch more work to do, I'll just keep working on it as I have time and hopefully put out a game in a month or two :)\n \n## Text!\nThis isn't quite a game yet, but it's getting really close to that point.\nI like it a lot anyway, but I wish I had another day or so. Ah well.\n\nThe original idea for this game was to make something like Starcraft, with a really tiny world.\nSome of the more interesting ideas in the space I haven't got around to exploring yet (multi-tile buildings, and taller maps that limit usable land)\n\nThis project was built with MonoGame - It should be portable to other platforms easily (though I haven't tried yet) via rebuild.\n\nControls are mouse only. Generally left drag = move, right drag = rotate camera\nGame mode is pretty standard RTS controls, click on thing, right click on other thing to interact\nIf you save a map in the editor (with two \"center\" structures), the main menu will give you the option to play that.\nNot much else to say, hope you find it interesting.\n\nI had a lot of fun putting this together, and I'm definitely going to continue to develop it after LD - I'm pretty happy with the structure and it will be pretty easy to add more features to it - I just didn't get the heavy lifting in time to start adding all the crazy features I wanted.\n\n",

I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause but I'm still learning how to develop in Unity. If you cannot play the game without rebinding I have created a version of the game with rebindable movement keys (aiming and firing remains unchanged). Nothing else has changed in the game, so this should play identically to the Compo Version, but it *is* a post-compo change. You can find it on the itch.io page as the (RebindableInput) version for your platform. More info [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/destruction-zone/rebindable-inputs).\n\nYou are a small drone defending what's left of a collapsing habitat station. Everything will be gone in five minutes, and as the station collapses the space you have to move safely decreases. Protect the towers holding the station together, or watch the station's inevitable demise accelerate!\nDestruction Zone is an 80's Arcade inspired twin-stick style shooter. How high can you score when the world is shrinking before your very eyes?\n\n**Postmortem:** https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/destruction-zone/destruction-zone-a-post-mortem-on-my-first-ludum-dare-game\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![2017-04-23 19_34_02-Greenshot.png](///raw/a06/2/z/ac4.png)![2017-04-23 19_34_38-Greenshot.png](///raw/a06/2/z/ac5.png)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nEvery X:30 you will be notified of the next area to disappear. At the X:00 second mark that section will disappear. Get caught in the emptiness and your health will plummet -- you need the energy of the station to survive!\nIf your health reaches zero you'll be reset to the center of the platform and respawn in five seconds. In that time enemies will be spawning so your job will become that much harder!\nThe structures with health bars above them are Support Towers. Those are the target of (most of) the robots and the thing that will keep your run going longer. When one of those is destroyed, it will add time to a clock. That time will be deducted from your time at six times speed!\n\n![Player_Unit.png](///raw/a06/2/z/a46.png)This is you! You've got your battery pack on your back and darn it, you're going to give these robots what-for, even if your fate is inevitable!\n\n![Enemy_Collider.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7f5.png)\nThe most common robot is the Collider. it has spikes. It will home in on a tower or you, whichever is closest.\n\n![Enemy_Bomber.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7f7.png)\nThe most dangerous robot by far is the Bomber. It roams between the towers, placing little 5-second treats that will explode, taking a tower with it. High priority targets, these.\n\n![Unit_Bomb.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fa.png)\nThese are their treats. Like candy to them.\n\n![Enemy_Shooter.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7f8.png)\nThe robots you'll encounter last are the Shooters. They want YOU. But if you happen to dodge and their bullet hits a tower, they're okay with that too. A variant you'll see with 45 seconds remaining is the Spread Shooter. It has the same Spread Shot you can acquire!\n\n**Power-Ups:**\n\n![DMG.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fb.png)Damage Power-Ups are Blue. They increase your damage by 1x. You can have up to Level 5 (5x damage).\n\n![RATE.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fc.png)Rate Power-Ups are Green. They increase your fire rate by 30% each time you pick one up. Get to Level 5 with these and you'll be shooting 2 times faster!\n\n![SPREAD.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fd.png)The Spread Power-Up (and you only need one) is Red. Pick this up to get a three-way shot. Probably overpowered, but the robots don't know that.\n\n**Timelapse**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ZuLaK2oNo\n\n**Debug Changelog:**\n\nApr-24-2017 9:37PM EDT:  [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/chronosv2/ld38/commit/87788345036c92d0be8fbdcfc7461ada1220b6bc)\n*  Forgot I lowered the resolution to 800x600 but left the UI scaled for 1024x768!\n  *  This lead to the Play button being inverted (made it invisible), the Score display was cut off, and the game status UI element was under the Penalty timer.

As I got working on it, however, I became worried that if I made the game too simple, then it would only be fun for a couple minutes. I wanted something that could be fun for more time. Unfortunately, this made polishing the game very difficult. Not to mention that this is my first time doing an action game, and I underestimated the difficulty of balancing the physics. As such, there are some problems with collisions, and the jump upgrade may make the player jump too high. I would have also liked to add in animations for the inanimate objects in the game.\n\n## Future Plans:\n\n* Animations for the inanimate objects\n* Polishing the physics\n* Adding tons of levels\n\n## Screenshots:\n\n![desert.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b5f.png)\n\n![world3.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b61.png)\n\n![achievements.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b63.png)",

While I did not finish even half of what I intended, I am excited to have drawn the line in the sand and have a working playable game for you guys to check out. I wasn't able to get to the tutorial part of the game, so below is a basic list of how to play the game.\n\n**Controls: **\n\nCustomizable at the splash screen, the inputs used by the game are: **Horizontal, Vertical, Fire1, Fire2**\n\n**W/A/S/D(Horizontal, Vertical):** Move your character around the board.\n\n**Left Mouse(Fire1):** \n\nDoes three important things, fires your grapple, pulls enemies that you have grappled, and destroys enemies during their vulnerable states (indicated by turning white temporarily.)\n\n**Right Mouse(Fire2):**\n\nDoes one important thing, pulls your character to a grappled enemy. This is used to escape your side when you are overwhelmed.\n\n**Rules of the Game**\n\nEnemies will spawn on both sides, fire your grapple to grab the enemy, pull them to you, and destroy them for points. The more enemies that spawn while your on one side the higher the multiplier gets. You can also increase your multiply by pulling enemies over and not destroying them.\n\nSwapping sides with the (default)Right Mouse resets your multiplier, but may be the key to staying alive.\nThe score gained per kill is determined both by your combo and multiplier, so the key to big highscores is both.\n\nYou are not able to grapple or destroy enemies on your side of the board.\n\n**Good Luck!**\n\nI don't know if there are comments on the final submission, but if there are, please leave one and let me know your thoughts / experiences / and optionally your high score.\n\nIn the coming days I'll add a blog post talking about the development of the game; what I was aiming for, what went right, what went wrong and so on. Hopefully you'll swing by to check that out once it is up.\n\n\n\n![screen01.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b91.png)![screen02.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b92.png)![screen04.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b94.png)\n\n\nLink to the source code(on bitbucket):\nhttps://bitbucket.org/Izunah/ld38mindthegap\n\nTools used: Unity 5.6, Visual Studio 2017, BFXR, Google",

The resulting game loop feels in a way repetitive, although the bullet hellish vibe can lift the gameplay to something. I will take this ludum dare as a lesson for two things I should've taken more into account: Optimization and Planification. \n\nHaving said that, I'm really happy with the humorous feel of the game and I tried to pump up the graphic quality and attention to detail compared to the previous game jam. While I don't feel like the final product is the best that I could do, I definitely think it was worth the effort. I hope you enjoy it.\n\n\n![smol.png](///raw/d5c/1/z/c57.png)\n\n## How to play:\n\nFor the best experience **I recommend playing the desktop version with a game controller**.\n\n**Move:** WASD / Arrowkeys / Joystick\n\n**Jump:** Spacebar / Y Button (Controller)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n[**Desktop (Recommended)**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9SPoBdYeh00X1ppWjVrbFQ1UzQ) | [**WebGL**](https://filogc.itch.io/badrng)\n\n[Source Project (Unity)](https://filogc.itch.io/badrng/download/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNDkzMjQxNjQ1LCJpZCI6MTM2ODIwfQ%3d%3d.32fv5p1OV7ylLz2A1LfZCo3LeMg%3d)",

But what if they all\n\nDisappeared?\n\nMany years ago, the Gods of the world removed all emotions from people, deciding that in order to reign supreme forever, the human's shouldn't feel anything. \n\nBut that all changes when Miyuki, a girl, is caught up in the godly affairs of Yuu, and the two go out. In order to free Yuu, you release the emotion of Loneliness, and after that decide there is much more to the world than it seemed.\n\nThis is the story of Emotions and how they affect our lives.\n\nWHAT WENT WELL: \nMusic (Soundtrack https://soundcloud.com/flygamer101/sets/kanjo-soundtrack)\nArt (To a certain Extent)\nStory (was ok, rushed)\n\nTHE BAD:\nGameplay (there isn't any)\nTime management\nStory\n\nREAL TALK:\nThis is completely unfinished. Right off the bat, I apologize for my \"Combat\" thing in the middle xD Seems so out of place. I kenw I wouldn't be able to finish in time, so for the last 2 hours or so, I cobbled together a shortened version of my original ending Idea, so the game doesn't feel right.

Similar to the film, the Fantastic Voyage, you control a microscopic ship and have to avoid a number of hazards.\n\nThere are two enemy types: \n - White blood cells who attack you\n - Platelets who cause you to slow down\n\nThere are also blue cubes that will clear the platelets.\n\nNotes for improvement\n=====================\n\nGameplay:\n- The platelets visually were going to stick to your craft\n- The blue cubes were going to be cuts in the vein that the platelet would break off from your ship to repair, allowing you to speed up\n\nArt:\n- Need to spend a lot more time in Blender making the assets for the platelets, white blood cells and \"cuts\"\n\nMusic:\n- I've been learning piano for a little while and played about with the trial version of Reason software for this project for the sfx and the music. I'd like to have invested more time on this.\n\nGeneral:\n- Time planning: standard issue with projects where you're embracing a lot of new things but now I've got a vague idea of how long various bits will take.\n\n- Testing of game through HTML 5 build needed as there are display issues and quit game bugs etc.\n\nAs my first go at building a game and still very much learning C#, Unity and Game Development in general I'm pretty pleased with the results in the time and am looking forward to the next Ludum Dare as I hope I'll be able to create something more complete.\n\nHope you enjoy :)\n\nBen\n\nLinks\n=====\nSource: https://github.com/MezzUK/TTIOAN/\n\nGame (standalone): https://github.com/MezzUK/TTIOAN/tree/master/GameBuild\n\nhttps://itch.io/embed-upload/452917?color=333333\n\nProject Tools\n=============\nUnity\nBlender\nReason 9 with Alesis VI49 keyboard\nCoffee\nFont - NovaMono\n\n![MainMenu.JPG](///raw/076/3/z/9f7.jpg)\n![Gameplay.JPG](///raw/076/3/z/a05.jpg)",

Your mission is to prevent more    assholes from being born!\n\n![BTILogo.png](///raw/d1f/2/z/10df.png)\n\n## Instructions\n1. Left-Click on sperm to kill them\n2. Left-Click and drag to draw barriers. Barriers will dissapear after 10 hits or 10s. They have a maximum length and wont stop the quick sperm!\n3. Right click to drop bait. You can only have 1 bait at a time(lasts 10s). Bait will attract sperm.\n4. The egg has a shield around it. The shield will kill sperm over time but it will die after 100 hits.\n5. Once the shield is down the first sperm to hit the egg will make you lose.\n\n__Last as much as you can!__\n\n## Description\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare. As you can see I kept the graphics pretty simple because my Photoshop and Blender skills are close to non existent. The mechanics are pretty simple and I mostly got them working in the first day. Second day was adding sound/music (totally overestimated my ability to do this), tweaking the graphics, creating the main menu and mostly trying to make it playable.\n\n__Some Notes for the future:__\n- I spent a lot of time reading the Unity Scripting API, UnityAnswers forum and StackOverflow. This was pretty unavoidable since it was my first time doing it but I'm sure I'll improve with time.\n- I got stuck refactoring part of the code and trying to make it more optimal. This made me waste a lot of time and got me frustrated. Ultimately I had to end hardcoding a lot of stuff anyway. Stupid for such a simple game.\n- I also didn't account for how my personal efficiency would plummet throughout the last hours.  \n\n## Tools\n- Unity 5.5\n- W10 voice recorder\n- Audio converter\n- beepbox (For the music)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwrr1z8bpijfn9z/A%20Too%20Small%20World%20Source%20Code.rar?dl=0)\n- [Win32](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ce5nrujhh1keb1z/Win.rar?dl=0)\n- [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/varhu865ro6fxlj/MacOS.app.rar?dl=0)\n- [Linux](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q37rn9s2euqrux1/Linux.rar?dl=0)\n- [Web](https://gris.itch.io/beware-the-idiots)\n\n## 48hours + Noob = Bugs\n\nSome of these are just improvements. Some are easy to solve(just needed more time) others require me to research. Since I'm not sure if I can make changes I'll just note them down below.\n\n- Clearer output on when the eggs shield is down\n- Quick sperm goes through the edgecollider(It wasn't meant to be this way)\n- Smoother lines (or maybe get rid of them? We'll see)\n- Better screen adjustment(mostly in the main menu)\n- Difficulty levels (Old man:Easy, Married middle aged man: Medium, Horny Teenager: Hard, Mr BlueBalls: Extreme)\n- Maybe keep a record of highscores?\n- Upgrades(different types of bait) \n\n\n",

Fish will go toward food, which is algae and pirmitive life. With food they'll breed.\n\nUse earth to build some place, use light to guide algae near earth, it will evolve into grass. This unlocks \"rain\".\n\nNote that grass and algae dies without light, so keep the light on.\n\nWhen fish are close to grass and there is no other food around in water, they'll evolve into animal on the ground.\n\nAnimal act the same as fish, but with grass as food.\n\nUsing rain on grass makes grass evolve into woods.\n\nAll steps above is a pure loss of your god power, so be careful.\n\n\n\nIf all above is done, horde and altar will be unlocked. Horde gives eternal light close to it.\n\nWhen fish, animal and woods are nearby, horde will get resource from them, which also make them disappear.\n\nAltar will use the resource of the nearest horde and restores your god power.\n\nWith enough resources horde will upgrade into village, and unlocks farm and mine.\n\nVillage will also collect resources from farm and mine, and will then upgrade into city.\n\nWith three cities, the laboratory will be unlocked.

Gather resources and build the greatest army this world has ever seen in order to repel those pesky beasts. Get help from the mighty wizard, and if you're lucky, the powerful warlock might even help you out.\n\nThis is my first ever entry to Ludum Dare. I had a blast making this game and I hope that you enjoy playing it! The game is made with LibGdx and written in Java. The assets has been made using Aseprite and Photoshop. The sound effects are created with Bfxr.\n\nI haven't really had time to play test it and balance it, so there's a big risk that it's somewhat unbalanced.\n\n![BugAttack.gif](///raw/9b8/2/z/122c.gif)\n\n### How to Play\nThe game plays somewhat like a basic RTS. Your goal is to survive the incoming waves of bugs by expanding your little village and building new units. You have two resources, pollen and resin. Resin is used for building new houses and Pollen is used for training new units.\n\n#### Unit Controls\n* Hold the left mouse button and drag to select your units.\n* When you have units selected click the right mouse button to order them to move.\n* To deselect your units, click the left mouse button.\n\n#### House Controls\n* Click on a house to select it.\n* When you have a house selected, some new options that you can do are shown in the menu bar on the bottom of the screen. \n* To deselect a house and get back to the overall menu, click the right mouse button.\n\n\n### Download Game: [Bug Attack!

It was my second LD participation and, looking at the feedbacks and final result, I think that I managed to create a better gaming experience than the previous one. On my first participation, I was discovering GameMaker Studio, so I chose to create a simple game, mainly focusing on graphics and mood. This time, I wanted to create something more complicated, and my limited knowledge of GameMaker Studio made me lose some precious minutes/hours, and I did not have enough time to polish the graphics and gameplay as much as I wanted. I still need to find this balance to provide both an interesting experience and nice graphics/mood, and of course speeding up my work. This will be for the next LD !\n\n![ld_res10.png](///raw/c60/3/z/4939.png)\n\nBut once again, thank you a lot @huvaakoodia, @elzach, @harusame, @zeriver, @lepatryckduffy, @itssaraficed, @iwa, @ursigames, @koreus7, @tommyflower, @lefaygames, @plepletier, @silkworm-sweatshop, @jupiter-hadley, @dink-dunk, @gris, @realitycheck, @powerspark, @smeax, @hdteav, @caterein, @tylerraz, @those-30-ninjas, @lipsch, @dragonzlay, @smiling-cat-entertainment, @antiwrapper, @siegfriedcroes and @jod !\n",

The planets and the stars, colossal giants drifting through space, thinking they're so great. It's time for the status quo to change in a gripping adventure full of romance, betrayal and 16th century colloquialisms. Unfortunately, your epic story switched engines mid-way through development and some of the content was cut. It's still pretty fun though!\n\n## Controls:\n\nMove your **mouse** around the asteroid and **click** to move towards your mouse pointer.\n\nYour impulse towards that point depends on how far away you **click**!\n\nCollide with **stellar objects** (such as asteroids) to absorb them.\n\nAbsorb **stellar objects** with a smaller **mass** than you to gain their **mass**!\n\nTry to absorb an object that's larger than you, however, and it'll be **game over**...\n\n## Endgame:\n\nUnfortunately, the game has no tear-jerking finale. However, do post the highest mass you obtain in the comments below and you can compare it to one of these many real life stellar objects:\n\n* Alpha Centauri: \n  * 2.2E+30 kg\n* R135a1 (Most massive star):\n  * 6.3E+32 kg\n* Min Supermassive Black Hole:\n  * 2.0E+35 kg\n* Max Supermassive Black Hole:\n  * 1.0E+41 kg\n\n## Ending Remarks\n\nThis is probably the most polished and complete game I have produced for Ludum Dare and in the shortest time! I've only been able to work on and off this weekend so I've probably only used 40% of those 48 hours. Thank you for taking the time to play it and please let me know any criticisms or bugs that you encounter!\n\n## Screenshots -\n\n![LD38(1).png](///raw/352/z/692.png)\n\n![LD38(2).png](///raw/352/z/693.png)\n\n![LD38(3).png](///raw/352/z/694.png)",

To expand your colony you will need to construct housing, greenhouses, and power plants.\n\nWhen you gather sufficient personnel, you can build turrets to protect merchants, upgrade your mines and weapons, and negotiate for a higher price for aether.\n\n#### Controls\n\nGameplay is mouse driven.

Enjoy!\n\nDeveloped using Stencyl development environment.\n\n#### Game Tips\nMerchant ships will pay a protection reward if they make it safely out of the mining zone. When you have sufficient funds and staff, build gun turrets to protect them.\n\nUpgraded mines will attract merchants that pay a higher rate for aether.\n\nThe core can store a small amount of aether, but you'll want to build storage tanks soon.

As a minor god, you just got your hands on the latest edition of the titular book, and will be setting down to follow the steps within in order to create small pocket worlds from various elements.\n\nThese worlds can in turn produce new elements, which can be incorporated into new worlds in order to form yet further elements.\n\nIt kind of reminds me of the game \"Alchemy\", with somewhat deeper gameplay, even though I did not start out with that game particularly in mind.\n\nIn the compo version, a total of 28 elements are implemented; it can easily be expanded.\n\n[Windows](http://www.smilingcatentertainment.com/download/PocketWorlds.1.0.0.6.zip)\n\n[Source](http://www.smilingcatentertainment.com/download/PocketWorlds-source.1.0.0.6.zip)\n\n![TheBasics.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/ce7.png)\n\nTips:\n\nIn order to advance, you WILL need to destroy worlds. A LOT of them. It will be a tough decision a lot of times.\n\nYou get +1% to your speed for every Space element in your aether.\n \nYou get +1% to your world building timer for every Time element in your aether.\n\nFor either of the above bonuses, you lose the bonus if you collect the element into a world.\n\nPlus element will combine with other free elements when building a world to give x3 the normal production for that element.\n\nBugfixes:\n\nFixed a sleepyhead bug where I transposed elements in the master formula list, causing it to be hard to reliably generate Life, Death, Plus, or Minus Element using the intended in-game instructions.\n\nFixed a sleepyhead bug where I misplaced the check for the win condition, causing the win UI to pop up endlessly.\n\n![InGame.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/cee.png)\n\n![World Creation Reference Poster Small.png](///raw/7e5/3/z/400e.png)\n\n[Windows](http://www.smilingcatentertainment.com/download/PocketWorlds.1.0.0.6.zip)\n\n[Source](http://www.smilingcatentertainment.com/download/PocketWorlds-source.1.0.0.6.zip)",

You can get a higher score by surviving longer but still dying.\n- Can you get a higher score?\n\n# Tech Stack\n\n## Main Game\n\n- Lua\n- Love2d\n\n## High Scores Server\n\n- Express\n- JavaScript\n- Node.js\n- MongoDB\n- Monk\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n*8/24/17*\n\n- Fixed a security bug where anyone could send data to the server\n- If the database was wiped, then the game would crash, we fixed that small problem\n\n# Known Issues\n\n- If you have an older version of the game and get a high score, it won't be recorded as the server no longer trusts you. Get a new version of the game in order to be trusted again.\n- Windows security center claims that my game is not secure and forces the user to click the `more info` button to play anyways\n- Apple claims that the game is insecure and forces the player to `right click open` to play.\n- When you get a high score your score is not always displayed in the list. It is there the next time you play though.\n- The bullet animation can be reset by firing again early",

The most ressources are found in the asteroid field M211 orbiting a black hole. Unfortunately these asteroids are very unstable, so the miners can call the A.M.O.R.V. to be evacuated in their escape pods as soon as they register dangerous activity. \nYou control one of these vehicles and need to find all the miners on the small planetoids before the time runs out. But beware! The weird gravity and the coriolis forces mess with your vehicles controls, so it is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nAvailable for Windows. Control with Joypad 1 or Cursor Keys to accelerate and turn vehicle.\n\nSince I started a bit (too?) late (again) not everything is as fleshed out as I'd like it to be, sound effects are missing, the pods look dev-art ugly and the volcanoes and other dangers I wanted to set up are simply not there. Sorry :smile:\nBut otherwise mostly everything should be playable, and the music is also there.\nEverything done, created, conceived, drawn, sampled, written during these 48hours using the great ZGameEditor, Audacity, OpenMPT and Anim8tor.\n\nWindows Executable and Sourcecode at \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/q5ayqu2c2mbubyy/ld38-amorv-v1.0.zip?dl=0\n\n\n",
